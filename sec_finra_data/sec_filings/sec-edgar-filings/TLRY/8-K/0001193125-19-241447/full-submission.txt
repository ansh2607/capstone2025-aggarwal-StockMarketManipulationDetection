<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Tilray&#146;s sole recourse for indemnification claims against the Privateer stockholders under the Merger Agreement (subject to certain exceptions, including
with respect to any fraud claims) is the cancellation of Escrow Shares. The &#147;Escrow Shares&#148; will be a number of shares of Tilray Class&nbsp;2 common stock equal to $125&nbsp;million divided by the Tilray Closing Price. The first 50% of the
Escrow Shares will be contributed by all Privateer stockholders on a pro rata basis based on each Privateer stockholder&#146;s portion of the Stock Merger Consideration (the &#147;Stockholder Escrow Shares&#148;), and the second 50% of the Escrow
Shares will be contributed by the Founders on a pro rata basis based on each Founder&#146;s portion of the shares of Tilray Class&nbsp;2 common stock allocated to all Founders in the merger (the &#147;Founder Escrow Shares&#148;). Indemnification
claims will be satisfied first from the Stockholder Escrow Shares and then from the Founder Escrow Shares. The Escrow Shares will be held in escrow for a period of 18 months after the closing of the merger, subject to certain exceptions, and the
Privateer stockholders will be entitled to exercise voting rights with respect to the Escrow Shares during the escrow period. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with the
merger, Tilray has agreed to pay up to $1&nbsp;million of transaction expenses incurred by Privateer. To the extent Privateer&#146;s transaction expenses exceed $1&nbsp;million, the Stock Merger Consideration will be reduced by a corresponding
amount of shares of Tilray Class&nbsp;2 common stock, as described above. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and
covenants made by Tilray and Privateer, including covenants relating to obtaining the requisite approvals of the stockholders of Tilray and Privateer, indemnification of directors and officers, and Privateer&#146;s conduct of business between the
date of signing of the Merger Agreement and the closing of the merger. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Tilray was formed as a subsidiary of Privateer. Privateer currently owns a
majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of Tilray&#146;s capital stock. As a result, Tilray is a &#147;controlled company&#148; within the meaning of the listing rules of the Nasdaq Global Select Market. However, Tilray will cease to
be a &#147;controlled company&#148; following the closing of the merger. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with the merger, Tilray expects to prepare and file with the U.S.

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The obligations of Tilray and Privateer to consummate the merger are subject to satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions including, among other things,
(a)&nbsp;the effectiveness of the registration statement, (b)&nbsp;no law or order preventing the transactions, (c)&nbsp;approval by Tilray&#146;s stockholders and Privateer&#146;s stockholders, (d)&nbsp;the approval for listing on the Nasdaq Global

among others, if the merger is not consummated on or before March&nbsp;9, 2020, which initial deadline may be extended for 60 days by Tilray or Privateer if a governmental body has requested additional information or if the SEC has not declared the
registration statement effective by at least 60 calendar days prior to the initial deadline. In addition, if Privateer stockholder approval is not obtained within 15 days of the registration statement becoming effective, and before Privateer
stockholder approval is actually obtained, both Tilray and Privateer may terminate the Merger Agreement, in which event Privateer will be required to reimburse Tilray for up to $3&nbsp;million in transaction expenses and the provisions of the
Privateer <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Lock-up</FONT> Agreement (described below) will apply. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Prior to obtaining Tilray stockholder approval, under
certain circumstances, Tilray may terminate the Merger Agreement in order to enter into an agreement to consummate an acquisition proposal that constitutes a superior offer, and the Tilray Board of Directors may change its recommendation to
Tilray&#146;s stockholders in connection with a superior offer or an intervening event. Further, Privateer may terminate the Merger Agreement in connection with an adverse change in the recommendation of the Tilray Board of Directors to
Tilray&#146;s stockholders. </P>

2019&#151;Tilray, Inc. (NASDAQ: TLRY), a global leader in cannabis research, cultivation, production, and distribution, today announced that it has signed a definitive merger agreement with its largest stockholder Privateer Holdings, Inc.
(&#147;Privateer&#148;) for a transaction that will extend the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">lock-up</FONT> on and provide for the issuance of up to 75&nbsp;million Tilray shares to Privateer&#146;s equity holders (and the cancellation of the
75&nbsp;million shares currently owned by Privateer). These shares currently represent 77&nbsp;percent of Tilray&#146;s total shares outstanding. Tilray and Privateer previously announced the signing of a
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-binding</FONT> Letter of Intent for this transaction on June 10, 2019. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This press release features multimedia. View
the full release here: <U>https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190909005492/en</U>/ </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the terms of the definitive agreement, the parties will
effect a downstream merger of Privateer with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tilray, with the Tilray subsidiary surviving the merger, and the issuance by Tilray to Privateer equity holders of newly issued and registered shares of Tilray common
stock and options to purchase shares of Tilray common stock in an aggregate amount equal to the number of Tilray common shares currently held by Privateer. As set forth in the definitive agreement, at its sole election (to be made prior to closing),
Tilray may pay a portion of the merger consideration in cash in lieu of issuing an equivalent number of shares of Tilray. All Tilray shares held by Privateer and all outstanding Privateer stock will be cancelled upon consummation of the merger. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Tilray was originally incubated and financed by Privateer as one of its wholly-owned operating subsidiaries before closing a Series A round of capital in
February 2018 and then becoming the first cannabis producer to complete an Initial Public Offering (IPO) on a major U.S. stock exchange in July 2018. Earlier this year, Privateer distributed its ownership of its three other operating subsidiaries
unrelated to Tilray directly to Privateer stockholders, leaving no material assets in Privateer other than the 75&nbsp;million shares it currently holds in Tilray. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pursuant to the terms of the definitive merger agreement, each Privateer equity holder who receives the shares of Tilray stock in the merger will be subject
to a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">lock-up</FONT> allowing for the sale of such shares only under certain circumstances over a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">two-year</FONT> period. During the first year following the closing of the merger,
shares will be released only pursuant to certain offerings or sales arranged by and at the discretion of Tilray. At the end of the first year, to the extent not already released as a result of any cash paid at closing and/or the aforementioned
offerings or sales, 50&nbsp;percent of the total shares subject to the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">lock-up</FONT> will be released. Over the course of the second year following closing, the remaining shares will be subject to a staggered
release in equal quarterly increments. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Mark Castaneda, Chief Financial Officer of Tilray, said: &#147;We appreciate the long-term confidence that
Privateer has in the Tilray business and we look forward to having their investors as part of our stockholder base. We believe this transaction will give Tilray greater control and operating flexibility, while allowing us to effectively manage our
public float.&#148; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Michael Blue, Managing Partner of Privateer, said: &#147;We are pleased to sign this agreement with Tilray, which we believe will
maximize overall returns </P>

merger consideration being Tilray Class&nbsp;2 Common Stock (which have one (1)&nbsp;vote per share). The merger agreement provides that $125&nbsp;million worth of Tilray Class&nbsp;2 Common Stock will be held in escrow for 18 months following the
closing of the transaction to secure any potential indemnification claims, with the initial 50&nbsp;percent of such escrow being withheld from all Privateer stockholders on a pro rata basis, and the remaining 50&nbsp;percent coming solely from the
Privateer cofounders. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The transaction has been unanimously approved by each of the Special Committee of Tilray&#146;s Board of Directors (comprised of
independent directors) and Privateer&#146;s Board of Directors. The merger and the transactions contemplated in connection therewith will be consummated only if all conditions to closing set forth in the merger agreement are satisfied, including the
requisite approval of the merger by the stockholders of Privateer and Tilray. Both parties intend to complete the transaction as expeditiously as possible. </P>
