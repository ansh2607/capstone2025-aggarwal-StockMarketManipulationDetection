<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On October&nbsp;10, 2018, Tilray, Inc. (&#147;Tilray&#148;) entered into an indenture relating to the issuance of $450&nbsp;million aggregate principal amount
of 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the &#147;notes&#148;) (the &#147;Indenture&#148;) by and between Tilray and GLAS Trust Company LLC, as trustee (the &#147;Trustee&#148;). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The notes will bear interest at a rate of 5.00% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on April&nbsp;1 and October&nbsp;1 of each year, beginning on
April&nbsp;1, 2019. Additional interest may accrue on the notes in specified circumstances set forth in the Indenture, including upon Tilray&#146;s failure to comply with certain reporting requirements. The notes will mature on October&nbsp;1, 2023,
unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The notes are convertible, at a holder&#146;s election, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, into
cash, shares of Tilray&#146;s Class&nbsp;2 common stock, par value $0.0001 (the &#147;Common Stock&#148;) or a combination of cash and shares of Tilray&#146;s Common Stock, at Tilray&#146;s election, at the applicable conversion rate (i)&nbsp;at any
time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding April&nbsp;1, 2023 only under the following circumstances: (1)&nbsp;during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on March&nbsp;31, 2019 (and
only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the Common Stock, for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the
immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price for the notes on each applicable trading day; (2)&nbsp;during the five business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period (the
&#147;measurement period&#148;) in which the trading price (as defined in the Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of the notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale of Common
Stock and the conversion rate for the notes on each such trading day; (3)&nbsp;if Tilray calls the notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date and
(4)&nbsp;upon the occurrence of specified corporate events as set forth in the Indenture or (ii)&nbsp;at any time on or after April&nbsp;1, 2023 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediate preceding the maturity date,
regardless of the foregoing circumstances. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The initial conversion rate for the notes is 5.9735 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of
notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $167.41 per share of Common Stock), subject to adjustment as provided in the Indenture. The initial conversion rate represents a premium of approximately 15% to the $145.57 per share
closing price of Common Stock on October&nbsp;4, 2018. The conversion rate for the notes is subject to adjustment under certain circumstances in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. In addition, following certain corporate events that occur
prior to the maturity date or if Tilray delivers a notice of redemption in respect of the notes, Tilray will, under certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate of the notes for a holder who elects to convert its notes in connection with such
a corporate event or notice of redemption, as the case may be. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Tilray may not redeem the notes prior to October&nbsp;1, 2021. Tilray may redeem for cash
all or any portion of the notes, at its option, on or after October&nbsp;1, 2021 and on or before the 30th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, if the last reported sale price of the Common Stock has been at least 130% of the
conversion price for the notes then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day
immediately preceding the date on which Tilray provides a notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the relevant redemption date.
No sinking fund is provided for the notes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If Tilray undergoes a fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture), holders may require Tilray to
repurchase for cash all or any portion of their notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding the fundamental change repurchase
date. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Indenture includes customary covenants and sets forth certain events of default after which the notes may be declared immediately due and
payable and set forth certain types of bankruptcy or insolvency events of default involving Tilray after which the notes become automatically due and payable. The following events are considered &#147;events of default&#148; under the Indenture:

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center"><B>Tilray Inc. Upsizes and Prices Offering of US$450 Million Convertible Senior Notes </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">NANAIMO, British Columbia &#150; October&nbsp;4, 2018 &#151;Tilray&nbsp;Inc. (NASDAQ:TLRY), a global leader in cannabis research, cultivation, production and
distribution, today announced the pricing of US$450&nbsp;million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the &#147;notes&#148;) in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#147;Securities Act&#148;). Any notes sold in Canada will only be sold to accredited investors pursuant to an exemption from the prospectus requirements of Canadian securities laws. Tilray also granted the
initial purchasers of the notes an option to purchase up to an additional US$67.5&nbsp;million aggregate principal amount of notes. The offering was upsized from the previously announced US$400&nbsp;million aggregate principal amount. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The sale of the notes to the initial purchasers is expected to settle on October&nbsp;10, 2018, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions,
and is expected to result in approximately US$435.0&nbsp;million in net proceeds to Tilray (or approximately US$500.5&nbsp;million if the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes in full) after deducting the initial
purchasers&#146; discount and estimated offering expenses payable by Tilray. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Tilray intends to use the net proceeds from this offering for working
capital, future acquisitions and general corporate purposes, and to repay the approximately US$9.1&nbsp;million existing mortgage related to its facility in Nanaimo, British Columbia. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The notes will be senior unsecured obligations of Tilray and will bear an interest at a rate of 5.00% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on
April&nbsp;1 and October&nbsp;1 of each year, beginning on April&nbsp;1, 2019. The notes will mature on October&nbsp;1, 2023, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The initial conversion rate for the notes is 5.9735 shares of Class&nbsp;2 common stock per US$1,000 principal amount of notes (which is equivalent to an
initial conversion price of approximately US$167.41 per share). Conversions of the notes will be settled in cash, shares of Tilray&#146;s Class&nbsp;2 common stock or a combination thereof, at Tilray&#146;s election. The initial conversion price
represents a conversion premium of approximately 15% over the last reported sale price of US$145.57 per share of Tilray&#146;s Class&nbsp;2 common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on October&nbsp;4, 2018. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Prior to the close of business on the day immediately preceding April&nbsp;1, 2023, the notes will be convertible at the option of the holders only upon the
satisfaction of specified conditions and during certain periods. On and after April&nbsp;1, 2023 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their notes at their option
regardless of these conditions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Holders may require Tilray to repurchase their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the
indenture governing the notes) at a cash purchase price equal to the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Tilray may not
redeem the notes prior to October&nbsp;1, 2021. On or after October&nbsp;1, 2021 and on or before the 30th&nbsp;scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, Tilray may redeem for cash all or part of the notes if the last reported sale
price of Tilray&#146;s Class&nbsp;2 common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive), including the trading day immediately preceding the date on which Tilray
provides a notice of redemption, during any 30 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which Tilray provides notice of redemption. The redemption price for the notes will equal the
principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center"><B>Tilray, Inc. Announces Closing of US$450 Million 5.00% Convertible Notes Offering </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">NANAIMO, British Columbia &#150; October&nbsp;10, 2018 &#150;Tilray,&nbsp;Inc. (NASDAQ:TLRY), a global leader in cannabis research, cultivation, production
and distribution, today announced that it has closed its offering of 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the &#147;notes&#148;) for gross proceeds of US$450&nbsp;million in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule
144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#147;Securities Act&#148;). Any notes sold in Canada were sold to accredited investors pursuant to an exemption from the prospectus requirements of Canadian securities laws. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Tilray estimates that the net proceeds from the offering is approximately&nbsp;US$435&nbsp;million, after deducting the initial purchasers&#146; discount and
estimated offering expenses payable by Tilray. Tilray intends to use the net proceeds from this offering for working capital, future acquisitions and general corporate purposes, and to repay the approximately US$9.1&nbsp;million existing mortgage
related to its facility in Nanaimo, British Columbia. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Cowen, BofA Merrill Lynch and BMO Capital Markets acted as joint book-running managers for the
offering. Roth Capital Partners, Eight Capital and Northland Capital Markets acted as <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">co-managers</FONT> for the offering. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The notes are senior unsecured obligations of Tilray and bear an interest at a rate of 5.00% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on April&nbsp;1 and
October&nbsp;1 of each year, beginning on April&nbsp;1, 2019. The notes mature on October&nbsp;1, 2023, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The initial conversion rate for the notes is 5.9735 shares of Class&nbsp;2 common stock per US$1,000 principal amount of notes (which is equivalent to an
initial conversion price of approximately US$167.41 per share). Conversions of the notes will be settled in cash, shares of Tilray&#146;s Class&nbsp;2 common stock or a combination thereof, at Tilray&#146;s election. The initial conversion price
represents a conversion premium of approximately 15% over the last reported sale price of US$145.57 per share of Tilray&#146;s Class&nbsp;2 common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on October&nbsp;4, 2018. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Neither the notes, nor any shares of Tilray&#146;s Class&nbsp;2 common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes, have been registered under the Securities
Act or any state securities laws, or qualified for distribution by prospectus in Canada, and unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from, or in a transaction not subject
to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and other applicable securities laws, or sold in Canada absent an exemption from the prospectus requirements of Canadian securities laws. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This press release is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall it constitute an offer, solicitation or sale of
any securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction. </P>
