still issuable under Sections&nbsp;3 and 4(a) above, which shall continue to be receivable thereafter)) issuable upon the exercise of the Warrant prior to such Fundamental Transaction, such shares of stock, securities, cash, assets or any other

the Warrants to be exercisable for more shares of Common Stock than the number that then remain authorized but unissued. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:36pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:6.5pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="center">Cooley
