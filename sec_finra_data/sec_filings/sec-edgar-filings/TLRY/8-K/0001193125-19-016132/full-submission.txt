<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On January&nbsp;21, 2018, Tilray, Inc. (&#147;Tilray&#148;) entered into a definitive agreement (the &#147;Arrangement Agreement&#148;) to acquire, through its
wholly-owned subsidiary High Park Gardens Inc., all of the issued and outstanding shares of Natura Naturals Holdings Inc. (&#147;Natura&#148;) for total consideration of up to C$70&nbsp;million. The acquisition of Natura will occur pursuant to a
plan of arrangement under Section&nbsp;182 of the Business Corporations Act (Ontario) (the &#147;Arrangement&#148;). In connection with its entrance into the Arrangement Agreement, pursuant to the terms of the Arrangement Agreement, Tilray also
entered into voting support agreements with the directors and officers of Natura and certain key shareholders of Natura, pursuant to which such persons agreed to vote the securities held by them in favor of the Arrangement at the special meeting of
Natura shareholders called to consider the Arrangement (the &#147;Natura Meeting&#148;). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pursuant to the Arrangement, and subject to certain customary
adjustments, Tilray will acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Natura in consideration for (a)&nbsp;the issuance of C$20&nbsp;million of shares of class 2 Common Stock of Tilray (&#147;Common Stock&#148;) to Natura shareholders
(the &#147;Share Consideration&#148;), (b) the payment of C$15&nbsp;million in cash to Natura Shareholders (the &#147;Cash Consideration&#148;) and (c)&nbsp;the issuance of promissory notes to the Natura Shareholders (the &#147;Promissory
Notes&#148; and, together with the Share Consideration and the Cash Consideration, the &#147;Consideration&#148;). Natura shareholders will receive their pro rata portion of the Cash Consideration after the deduction of certain transaction expenses
incurred by Natura and subject to applicable withholding taxes. The Promissory Notes will entitle the Natura Shareholders to up to an additional C$35&nbsp;million of Tilray Common Stock contingent upon the achievement by Natura of certain quarterly
production milestones over the 12 month period beginning on February&nbsp;1, 2019. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Common Stock issuable upon the closing of the Arrangement will be
issued at a price per share of Common Stock equal to the greater of (a)&nbsp;the 10 day volume-weighted average price (&#147;VWAP&#148;) of shares of the Common Stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (the &#147;Nasdaq&#148;) for the 10 trading day
period ending on January&nbsp;29, 2019 and (b)&nbsp;the lowest price permitted by the Nasdaq. The Common Stock issuable upon the achievement of the quarterly production milestones, if any, will be issued at a price per share of Common Stock equal to
the greater of (a)&nbsp;the 15 day VWAP of shares of Common Stock on the Nasdaq for the 15 trading day period beginning on the trading day immediately following the end of the applicable three month period and (b)&nbsp;the lowest price permitted by
the Nasdaq. No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">At the effective time of the Arrangement: (i)&nbsp;all <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT

Common Stock (&#147;Tilray Warrants&#148;), such Tilray Warrants being exercisable at an adjusted exercise price for an adjusted amount of Common Stock. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The completion of the Arrangement is subject to customary conditions precedent, including approval by 66<SUP STYLE="vertical-align:top">2</SUP>&#8260;<SUB

customary representations and warranties for a transaction of the nature of the Arrangement. Unless otherwise agreed to by Natura and Tilray, the closing of the Arrangement must occur on or before February&nbsp;28, 2019. In the event that the
Arrangement Agreement is terminated by Natura or Tilray in certain circumstances, including in the event that Natura accepts a &#147;superior proposal&#148;, Natura shall be liable to pay Tilray a
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">&#147;break-fee&#148;</FONT> of $2,100,000. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Arrangement

Agreement, and not to provide investors with any other factual information regarding Natura or its business. Stockholders should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual
