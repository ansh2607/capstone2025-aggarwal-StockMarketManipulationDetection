The forward-looking statements are expressly qualified by this cautionary statement. Any information or statements that are contained in this communication that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements in this communication with regards to: (i)&#160;statements relating to Aphria&#8217;s and Tilray&#8217;s strategic business combination and the expected terms, timing and closing of the Arrangement including, receipt of required regulatory approvals, shareholder approvals, court approvals and satisfaction of other closing customary conditions; (ii)&#160;estimates of <span style="white-space:nowrap">pro-forma</span> financial information of the combined company, including in respect of expected revenues and production of cannabis; (iii)&#160;estimates of future costs applicable to sales; (iv)&#160;estimates of future capital expenditures; (v)&#160;estimates of future cost reductions, synergies including <span style="white-space:nowrap">pre-tax</span> synergies, savings and efficiencies; (vi)&#160;statements that the combined company anticipates to have scalable medical and <span style="white-space:nowrap">adult-use</span> cannabis platforms expected to strengthen the leadership position in Canada, United States and internationally; (vii)&#160;statements that the combined company is expected to offer a diversified and branded product offering and distribution footprint, world-class cultivation, processing and manufacturing facilities; (viii)&#160;statements in respect of operational efficiencies expected to be generated as a result of the Arrangement in the amount of more than C$100&#160;million of <span style="white-space:nowrap">pre-tax</span> annual cost synergies; (ix)&#160;expectations of future balance sheet strength and future equity; (x)&#160;that the combined company is expected to unlock significant shareholder value; and (xi)&#160;statements under the heading &#8220;Strategic and Financial Benefits&#8221; of this communication. Aphria and Tilray use words such as &#8220;forecast&#8221;, &#8220;future&#8221;, &#8220;should&#8221;, &#8220;could&#8221;, &#8220;enable&#8221;, &#8220;potential&#8221;, &#8220;contemplate&#8221;, &#8220;believe&#8221;, &#8220;anticipate&#8221;, &#8220;estimate&#8221;, &#8220;plan&#8221;, &#8220;expect&#8221;, &#8220;intend&#8221;, &#8220;may&#8221;, &#8220;project&#8221;, &#8220;will&#8221;, &#8220;would&#8221; and the negative of these terms or similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. Various assumptions were used in drawing the conclusions contained in the forward-looking statements throughout this communication. Forward-looking statements reflect current beliefs of management of Aphria and Tilray with respect to future events and are based on information currently available to each respective management including based on reasonable assumptions, estimates, internal and external analysis and opinions of management of Aphria and Tilray considering their experience, perception of trends, current conditions and expected developments as well as other factors that each respective management believes to be relevant as at the date such statements are made. Forward-looking statements involve significant known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause actual results, performance or achievement to be materially different from any future forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to, risks assumptions and expectations described in Aphria&#8217;s and Tilray&#8217;s critical accounting policies and estimates; the adoption and impact of certain accounting pronouncements; Aphria&#8217;s and Tilray&#8217;s future financial and operating performance; the competitive and business strategies of Aphria and Tilray ; the intention to grow the business, operations and potential activities of Aphria and Tilray; the ability of Aphria and Tilray to complete the Arrangement; Aphria&#8217;s and Tilray&#8217;s ability to provide a return on investment; Aphria&#8217;s and Tilray&#8217;s ability to maintain a strong financial position and manage costs, the ability of Aphria and Tilray to maximize the utilization of their existing assets and investments and that the completion of the Arrangement is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions as set forth in the Arrangement Agreement. There can be no assurance as to when these conditions will be satisfied or waived, if at all, or that other events will not intervene to delay or result in the failure to complete the Arrangement. There is a risk that some or all the expected benefits of the Arrangement may fail to materialize or may not occur within the time periods anticipated by Aphria and Tilray. The challenge of coordinating previously independent businesses makes evaluating the business and future financial prospects of the combined company following the Arrangement difficult. Material risks that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements also include the inherent uncertainty associated with the financial and other projections; the prompt and effective integration of the combined company; the ability to achieve the anticipated synergies and value-creation contemplated by the proposed transaction; the risk associated with Aphria&#8217;s and Tilray&#8217;s ability to obtain the approval of the proposed transaction by their shareholders required to consummate the proposed transaction and the timing of the closing of the proposed transaction, including the risk that the conditions to the transaction are not satisfied on a timely basis or at all; the risk that a consent or authorization that may be required for the proposed transaction is not obtained or is obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated; the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against the parties and others related to the Arrangement Agreement; unanticipated difficulties or expenditures relating to the transaction, the response of business partners and retention as a result of the announcement and pendency of the transaction; risks relating to the value of Tilray&#8217;s common stock to be issued in connection with the transaction; the impact of competitive responses to the announcement of the transaction; and the diversion of management time on transaction-related issues.</p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For a more detailed discussion of risks and other factors, see the most recently filed annual information form of Aphria and the annual report filed on form <span style="white-space:nowrap">10-K</span> of Tilray made with applicable securities regulatory authorities and available on SEDAR and EDGAR.
