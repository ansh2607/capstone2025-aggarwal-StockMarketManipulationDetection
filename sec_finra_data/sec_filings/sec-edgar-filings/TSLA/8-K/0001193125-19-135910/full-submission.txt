electric vehicles, solar energy generation systems and energy storage products. We also offer maintenance, installation, operation and other services related to our products. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:5%; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL">Our production vehicle fleet includes our Model S premium sedan and our Model X SUV, which are our highest-performance vehicles, and our Model 3, a
lower-priced sedan designed for the mass market. We continue to enhance our vehicle offerings with enhanced Autopilot options, internet connectivity and free
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">over-the-air</FONT></FONT> software updates to provide additional safety, convenience and performance features. In March 2019, we unveiled Model Y, a compact SUV utilizing the Model 3
platform, which we expect to produce at high volumes by the end of 2020. In April 2019, we also introduced the next generation of powertrain for Model S and Model X, with 370 and 325 miles (EPA) of maximum range, respectively. In addition, we have
several future electric vehicles in our product pipeline, including Tesla Semi, a pickup truck and a new version of the Tesla Roadster. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:5%; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL">We also
sell and lease retrofit solar energy systems and sell renewable energy and energy storage products, and are ramping our Solar Roof product that combines solar energy generation with attractive, integrated styling. Our energy storage products, which
we manufacture at Gigafactory 1, consist of Powerwall, mostly for residential applications, and Powerpack, for commercial, industrial and utility-scale applications. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:5%; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL">In order to facilitate our continued growth, we are undertaking various initiatives. These include plans to develop Model Y and Tesla Semi, expand our
Supercharger and vehicle service and repair networks, and invest in our manufacturing facilities, including Tesla Factory and our Gigafactories in Nevada, New York and Shanghai. In particular, Gigafactory Shanghai is a key strategic component for
our growth in China, the largest electric vehicle market in the world, and we are proud to be the first wholly foreign-owned vehicle manufacturer in the country. As part of this project, we have agreed with the local government to spend
approximately $2 billion in capital expenditures over the next five years (which is already included in our capital expenditure plans), and to generate approximately $270&nbsp;million of annual tax revenues starting at the end of 2023. We believe
the tax revenue target will be easily </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:5%; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL">Our mission is to accelerate the world&#146;s transition to sustainable energy. We design, develop, manufacture, lease and sell high-performance fully
electric vehicles, solar energy generation systems and energy storage products. We also offer maintenance, installation, operation and other services related to our products. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:5%; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL">Our production vehicle fleet includes our Model S premium sedan and our Model X SUV, which are our highest-performance vehicles, and our Model 3, a
lower-priced sedan designed for the mass market. We continue to enhance our vehicle offerings with enhanced Autopilot options, internet connectivity and free
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">over-the-air</FONT></FONT> software updates to provide additional safety, convenience and performance features. In March 2019, we unveiled Model Y, a compact SUV utilizing the Model 3
platform, which we expect to produce at high volumes by the end of 2020. In April 2019, we also introduced the next generation of powertrain for Model S and Model X, with 370 and 325 miles (EPA) of maximum range, respectively. In addition, we have
several future electric vehicles in our product pipeline, including Tesla Semi, a pickup truck and a new version of the Tesla Roadster. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:5%; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL">We also
sell and lease retrofit solar energy systems and sell renewable energy and energy storage products, and are ramping our Solar Roof product that combines solar energy generation with attractive, integrated styling. Our energy storage products, which
we manufacture at Gigafactory 1, consist of Powerwall, mostly for residential applications, and Powerpack, for commercial, industrial and utility-scale applications. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:5%; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL">In order to facilitate our continued growth, we are undertaking various initiatives. These include plans to develop Model Y and Tesla Semi, expand our
Supercharger and vehicle service and repair networks, and invest in our manufacturing facilities, including Tesla Factory and our Gigafactories in Nevada, New York and Shanghai. In particular, Gigafactory Shanghai is a key strategic component for
our growth in China, the largest electric vehicle market in the world, and we are proud to be the first wholly foreign-owned vehicle manufacturer in the country. As part of this project, we have agreed with the local government to spend
approximately $2 billion in capital expenditures over the next five years (which is already included in our capital expenditure plans), and to generate approximately $270 million of annual tax revenues starting at the end of 2023. We believe the tax
revenue target will be easily </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">PALO ALTO, CA, May&nbsp;2, 2019 &#150; Tesla, Inc. today announced offerings of $650&nbsp;million of common stock and $1,350&nbsp;million aggregate principal
amount of convertible senior notes due in 2024 in concurrent underwritten registered public offerings. In addition, Tesla has granted the underwriters a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">30-day</FONT> option to purchase up to an additional 15% of
each offering. Elon Musk, Tesla&#146;s CEO, will participate by purchasing $10&nbsp;million of common stock. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The aggregate gross proceeds of the
offerings, assuming full exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional securities, would be&nbsp;approximately $2.3&nbsp;billion before discounts and expenses. Tesla intends to use the net proceeds from the offerings to further
strengthen its balance sheet, as well as for general corporate purposes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The notes in this offering will be convertible into cash and/or shares of
Tesla&#146;s common stock at Tesla&#146;s election. The interest rate, conversion price and other terms of the notes are to be determined. With respect to the notes, Tesla intends to enter into convertible note hedge transactions and warrant
transactions to limit dilution of its common stock. In connection with establishing their initial hedge of the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions, the hedge counterparties or their affiliates expect to enter into various derivative
transactions with respect to Tesla&#146;s common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the notes, including with certain investors in the notes.</P>
