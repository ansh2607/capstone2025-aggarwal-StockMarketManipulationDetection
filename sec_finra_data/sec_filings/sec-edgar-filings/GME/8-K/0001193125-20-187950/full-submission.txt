In addition, at any time on or prior to March&#160;15, 2022, the Company may, subject to certain limitations specified in the New Notes Indenture, at its option and on one or more occasions, redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the New Notes at a redemption price equal to 110.00% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings.
