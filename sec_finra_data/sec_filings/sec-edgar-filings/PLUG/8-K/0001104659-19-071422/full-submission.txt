promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the &ldquo;<B>indemnifying party</B>&rdquo;) in writing
and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified
party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay
the reasonably incurred, documented fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding,
any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the
expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed in writing
to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both
the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate
due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect
of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction,
be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified
parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing
by you, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section &lrm;8(a), and by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified
pursuant to Section &lrm;8(b). The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without
its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party
agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding
the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified
party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the indemnifying party
agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement
is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying
party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No
indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or
threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought
hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all
liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.</P>

by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering
of the Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause &lrm;8(d)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion

the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate Public Offering Price of the Shares. The relative fault of the

the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates
to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties&rsquo; relative intent, knowledge, access to information
and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Underwriters&rsquo; respective obligations to contribute
pursuant to this Section &lrm;8 are several in proportion to the respective number of Shares they have purchased hereunder, and
not joint.</P>

The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section &lrm;8
were determined by <I>pro rata</I> allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any
other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section &lrm;8(d). The amount
paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section &lrm;8(d)
shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such
indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this
Section &lrm;8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at
which the Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages
that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be
entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in
this Section &lrm;8 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified
party at law or in equity.</P>
