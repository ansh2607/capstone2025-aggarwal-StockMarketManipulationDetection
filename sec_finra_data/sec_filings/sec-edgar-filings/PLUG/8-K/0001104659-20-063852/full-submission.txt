a Delaware corporation (the &#8220;Company&#8221;), agreed to sell to the several initial purchasers (the &#8220;Initial

of the Company&#8217;s 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the &#8220;initial notes&#8221;), pursuant
to a purchase agreement (the &#8220;Purchase Agreement&#8221;) between the Company and the Initial Purchasers. The Company also granted the
Initial Purchasers an option to purchase from the Company up to an additional $30.0 million aggregate principal amount of the
Company&#8217;s 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the &#8220;additional notes&#8221; and, together with the initial

$90.9 million of the net proceeds from the offering of the initial notes to finance the cash portion of the consideration it delivered

from the offering to fund eligible green projects designed to contribute to selected Sustainable Development Goals as defined
by the United Nations and for working capital and other general corporate purposes, which may include potential acquisitions and

initial notes and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted
initial notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap, based on the cap price of the Base
Capped Call Transactions. The cap price of the Base Capped Call Transactions is initially $6.7560, which represents a premium
of approximately 60% over the last reported sale price of the Company&#8217;s common stock on May 13, 2020. The cost of the
Base Capped Call Transactions was approximately $15.3 million. If the Initial Purchasers exercise their option to purchase

Trading Day of the Measurement Period was less than 98% of the product of the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock
and the Conversion Rate on each such Trading Day (the &#8220;<B>Trading Price Condition</B>&#8221;). The Trading Prices shall

set forth in this Indenture. The Bid Solicitation Agent (if other than the Company) shall have no obligation to solicit bids
as described above unless the Company has requested such solicitation in writing, and the Company shall have no obligation to
make such request (or, if the Company is acting as Bid Solicitation Agent, the Company shall have no obligation to solicit
such bids) unless a Holder of at least $2,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Notes provides the Company with reasonable
evidence that the Trading Price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes would be less than 98% of the product of the Last
Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock and the Conversion Rate, at which time the Company shall instruct the Bid
Solicitation Agent in writing (if other than the Company) to solicit, or if the Company is acting as Bid Solicitation Agent,

Price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes is greater than or equal to 98% of the product of the Last Reported Sale Price of
the Common Stock and the Conversion Rate and the Company shall instruct the three independent nationally recognized
securities dealers to deliver bids to the Bid Solicitation Agent. The Company shall determine the Trading Price per $1,000
principal amount of the Notes for each Trading Day in accordance with the bids so solicited. If (x) the Company is not acting
as Bid Solicitation Agent, and the Company does not, when the Company is required to, instruct the Bid Solicitation Agent in
writing to obtain bids, or if the Company so instructs the Bid Solicitation Agent in writing to obtain bids and the Bid
Solicitation Agent fails to obtain such bids, or (y) the Company is acting as Bid Solicitation Agent and the Company fails to
obtain such bids, then, in either case, the Trading Price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes shall be deemed to be less
than 98% of the product of the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock and the Conversion Rate on each Trading Day of
such failure. At such time as the Company directs the Bid Solicitation Agent (if other than the Company) in writing to
solicit bid quotations, the Company shall provide the Bid Solicitation Agent (if other than the Company) with the names and
contact details of the three independent nationally recognized securities dealers selected by the Company and the Company
shall direct these securities dealers to provide bids to the Bid Solicitation Agent. If the Trading Price condition set forth
above has been met, the Company shall so notify the Holders, the Trustee and the Conversion Agent (if other than the Trustee)
in writing on or within one Business Day of such determination. If, at any time after the Trading Price condition set forth
above has been met, the Trading Price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes is greater than or equal to 98% of the product of
the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock and the Conversion Rate for such Trading Day, the Company shall so notify
the Holders, the Trustee and the Conversion Agent (if other than the Trustee) in writing that the Trading Price Condition is
no longer met and thereafter neither the Company nor the Bid Solicitation Agent (if other than the Company) shall be required
to solicit bids again until another qualifying request is made as provided above.</P>

conversion, a Holder shall not receive any separate cash payment for accrued and unpaid interest, if any, except as set forth
below and the Company shall not adjust the Conversion Rate for any accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes. The
Company&#8217;s settlement of the full Conversion Obligation shall be deemed to satisfy in full its obligation to pay the
principal amount of the Note and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the relevant Conversion Date. As a
result, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the relevant Conversion Date shall be deemed to be paid in
full rather than cancelled, extinguished or forfeited. Upon a conversion of Notes into a combination of cash and shares of
Common Stock, accrued and unpaid interest will be deemed to be paid first out of the cash paid upon such conversion.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Notes are converted after the close of business on a Regular Record Date and prior to the
open of business on the corresponding Interest Payment Date, Holders of such Notes as of the close of business on such
Regular Record Date will receive the full amount of interest payable on such Notes (to, but not including such Interest
Payment Date) on the corresponding Interest Payment Date notwithstanding the conversion. Notes surrendered for conversion
during the period from the close of business on any Regular Record Date to the open of business on the immediately following
Interest Payment Date, however, must be accompanied by funds equal to the amount of interest payable on the Notes so
converted on the corresponding Interest Payment Date (regardless of whether the converting Holder was the Holder of Record on
such Regular Record Date); <I>provided</I> that no such payment shall be required (1) for conversions following the Regular
Record Date immediately preceding the Maturity Date; (2) if the Company has specified a Fundamental Change Repurchase Date
that is after a Regular Record Date and on or prior to the Business Day immediately succeeding the corresponding Interest
Payment Date; (3) if the Company has specified a Redemption Date that is after a Regular Record Date and on or prior to the
Business Day immediately succeeding the corresponding Interest Payment Date; or (4)&nbsp;to the extent of any overdue
interest, if any overdue interest exists at the time of conversion with respect to such Note. Therefore, for the avoidance of
doubt, all Holders of record on the Regular Record Date immediately preceding the Maturity Date shall receive the full
interest payment due on the Maturity Date in cash regardless of whether their Notes have been converted following such
Regular Record Date.</P>

to convert its Notes in connection with such Make-Whole Fundamental Change or (y) the Company issues a Redemption Notice with
respect to any or all of the Notes pursuant to &#8206;Section 16.02 (<I>provided</I> that, if the Company sends a Notice of
Redemption for fewer than all of the Notes outstanding, then the Conversion Rate will be increased as set forth herein only
with respect to the Notes called (or deemed called ) for Optional Redemption that are converted in connection therewith, and
not with respect to the Notes not called for Optional Redemption, so that in that circumstance, Holders of Notes not called
for Optional Redemption will not be entitled to an increased Conversion Rate for such Notes as set forth in this Section
14.03 on account of the Optional Redemption; <I>provided further</I> that, notwithstanding the foregoing and for the
avoidance of doubt, Notes (or beneficial interests in a Global Note, as applicable) that are deemed to be called for such

therewith in accordance with the provisions of this Article 14 will be entitled to an increased Conversion Rate for such
Notes as set forth herein on account of such deemed partial Optional Redemption) and, in each case, a Holder elects to

be, the Company shall, under the circumstances described below, increase the Conversion Rate for the Notes so surrendered for
conversion by a number of additional shares of Common Stock (the &#8220;<B>Additional Shares</B>&#8221;), as described below.
A conversion of Notes shall be deemed for these purposes to be &#8220;in connection with&#8221; such Make-Whole Fundamental
Change if the relevant Conversion Date occurs during the period from, and including, the Effective Date of the Make-Whole
Fundamental Change up to, and including, the close of business on the Business Day immediately prior to the related
Fundamental Change Repurchase Date (or, in the case of a Make-Whole Fundamental Change that would have been a Fundamental

Date of such Make-Whole Fundamental Change) (such period, the &#8220;<B>Make-Whole Fundamental Change Period</B>&#8221;). For
the avoidance of doubt, the Company may not increase the Conversion Rate pursuant to the provisions of this Section 14.03 on

Stock receive only cash in such Share Exchange Event, then for all conversions for which the relevant Conversion Date occurs
after the effective date of such Share Exchange Event (A) the consideration due upon conversion of each $1,000 principal
amount of Notes shall be solely cash in an amount equal to the Conversion Rate in effect on the Conversion Date (as may be
increased by any Additional Shares pursuant to &#8206;Section 14.03), <I>multiplied by</I> the price paid per share of Common
Stock in such Share Exchange Event and (B) the Company shall satisfy the Conversion Obligation by paying such cash amount to
converting Holders on the second Business Day immediately following the relevant Conversion Date. The Company shall notify
Holders, the Trustee and the Conversion Agent (if other than the Trustee) in writing of such weighted average as soon as
reasonably practicable after such determination is made.</P>
