the effort really wasn't that good. The service, which we had third parties doing for us, didn't work. My friends at Walmart said to me,
 &quot;Plug, if you want to sell anything, you have to be able to provide us the fuel, you had to build the fueling stations, you have
to provide the aftermarket service.&quot;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">I'm not the smartest guy in the world, but I sat back and said, &quot;Hey,
if my customer is telling us that's what we have to do to sell product, that's what we'll do.&quot; That journey was really important
and probably the most important meeting I have had during my career at Plug. Because of that meeting, we began to understand the importance
of a hydrogen ecosystem. You couldn't just provide one part of it. You had to really think about it as a system.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">That's really what we have done at Plug. We have really built out the
hydrogen ecosystem. If you think about it, we have gone out and asked folks to join us. We don't really purchase companies. We've done
a lot of acquisitions, but everyone who has come to the Plug team, we asked them to come join us. We bought the first company in Tennessee
that knew how to build hydrogen plants.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">They're the ones who did the first liquid hydrogen plant ever outside
the industrial gas companies. That was really important to us, that United Hydrogen, and we started dreaming about how we could do 500
tons a day of green hydrogen, and we thought to ourselves, &quot;We really needed to have electrolyzer capability. Plug went and asked
a group of folks who are really research folks for stacks in Concord, Massachusetts to come join the Plug team.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">We bought a company Giner ELX which had the best stack technology in
the world. Just go check the DOE website. That's just not Andy Marsh telling you that. Then we went and bought a company that actually
knew how to make large-scale electrolyzer systems and plants. This company was in the Netherlands, it gave us a European footprint. The
company was Frames. In 18 months, we've taken a company that was 100% oil and gas and transitioned them to renewable energy. That's pretty
remarkable, 250 folks both in the Netherlands, and Pune,&nbsp;India. We changed the business models, but they had the skill sets that
were required to make the transition possible.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">We also understood that cryogenics was really important to the success
of this business. That's why, we have two companies that we acquired in Houston, Texas, who were experts in O&amp;G. Again,&nbsp;I think
this is Plug thinking through how do you transition these industries? We've taken those team and now they're building cryogenics liquid
hydrogen trailers as well as liquefying hydrogen. Folks in Tennessee that we added actually gave us a logistic network. I think probably
we have the first or second largest number of hydrogen trucks on the road supporting customers.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">There's over-- I was going to say 39, but we have the 40th out there
today. We actually have over 40 trailers on the road making sure our customers have hydrogen all the time, and that's really critical.
When you think about it and then you get to the fueling stations, you see our large-scale stationary products, you see today we still
are putting out lots of fuel cells forklift trucks, we have some good friends from FreezPak here who are kind of leaders in freezer applications
for distribution to wholesale folks.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">You look around, Plug has actually done it all, and the whole ecosystem,
Plug has really made it come together. Hydrogen is really important in this journey that when you take a step back when it comes to climate
change, people get all excited about mobility and other items, but 26% of the CO2s being emitted is actually being for things which aren't
all that exciting but are really important like making ammonia, like making green steel, like making concrete.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The carbon footprint in those items is as large as the carbon footprint
for mobility, but hydrogen certainly is a better solution we believe for many, many commercial applications and mobility today. I think
ultimately other applications when it comes to mobility. Hydrogen is really the Swiss Army knife of this transition to renewable energy.
We're going to help the world get to net zero, and look,&nbsp;I know that there are a lot of investors in this room, it's a big business
opportunity. People like-- No, not Plug. People like Bloomberg and Goldman are talking about this being a 20% of world's energy coming
from hydrogen, it could be a $10-trillion-a-year opportunity. It's huge.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Look, when I take another step back and today you're going to hear
some really great presentations. Sanjay Shrestha is going to talk about not only the 500 tons in a day green hydrogen that we're developing
here across the United States but also our expansion in the Europe where we're building,&nbsp;I know my friends from Antwerp-Bruges are
here today where we're building a plant in Antwerp-Bruges of liquid hydrogen. Sanjay said to me and I think you'll hear it from him today
and it puts a smile on my face every time he says it, and it's something I believe, we are going to be the category king with green hydrogen.
Nobody is doing what we're doing.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Then we're going to hear from Ole Hoefelmann who really, he's come
and joined us about 18 or 19 months ago, and took a group of about 15 folks, 20 folks, and turned it into a business for us in the electrolyzer
business. This here is a real, real cool picture. That's the first offshore electrolyzer, really, really need, but this business is always
going to say has a sales funnel of over $25 billion today.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Sales funnel is not sales, but it just shows the level of interest
in this business. On top of that, all he's going to talk about how we have 1.5 gigawatts already for this product that we just really
started. Jose is going to talk about all our applications, especially the stationary power market, which when we step back and you think
about, as my chairman will tell me, &quot;Andy, you're riding four unicorns.&quot; One of them is the great work Sanjay is doing with
green hydrogen. Another unicorn for Plug is this electrolyzer business.</P>

products can be over $350 billion opportunity in the near term. I think probably many of you have seen what Microsoft said about our products.
You're going to hear from our buddy in Europe. I really like this picture. Our buddy in Europe, Benjamin Haycraft who runs our activities
about the huge opportunity Plug has in Europe, who today is going to talk about some new pedestal customers in Europe today, going to
talk about our HYVIA JV. I think you'll really enjoy that. Now, before I turn it over to the team,&nbsp;I always think, when I think about
Plug, what we do is real things.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Last night, most of you were on the tour, and those who are online,
you can do a virtual tour. You saw a world-class Gigafactory that Dave Mindnich and his team here in Rochester have been building as well
as other plants around the world. If I look out this window, and I know those online can't see it, you see a cryogenic trailer that I
actually saw a week ago in Houston, Texas being built. Now it was driven up here from one of our drivers from Tennessee that delivered
this to show off our technology outside. Nobody else could show this level of product.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">You can see the Plug electrolyzer. It's a 5-megawatt electrolyzer skid
that's destined for our plant in Georgia. You see the HYVIA van, and you'll hear more about that van today. A point I always like to emphasize,
Plug is not vaporware. This is not just power point, this is real things, and real things are tough sometimes, but Plug does real things.
I'm going to get off stage so you can hear the real details, but let me say this, we have a tagline that says, &quot;Hydrogen at Work.&quot;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">I think if you look around this building outside, you really do see
hydrogen at work. It is now my pleasure to introduce our VP of Operations who's done a wonderful job helping really to think through how
we scale this business, Dave Mindnich as well as my buddy Dan O'Connell, who again joined the Plug party. We acquired Dan's company years
ago, and we've taken that from 4 people to 275, Dan, and Dan is going to tell-- Dan really drove so much of the work that made this facility
here in Rochester possible. Dave and Dan, it's time for you guys.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Dave Mindnich: </B>Thank you Andy, and welcome to the world's first
PEM Innovation Center in Gigafactory that Dan and his team have been building over the last two years. A little bit about Dan, a little
bit more. Dan has been in the fuel cell industry for over 30 years with his last position, as Andy mentioned, as the CEO of American Fuel
Cell. Dan has also been an advocate for this region for a really long time, and he has built a world-class team here in Rochester that
you got to meet last night. The team that Dan has built in Rochester is I would put up against any team I've ever seen or worked with,
so thank you, Dan, great job. It's on to you, bud.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Dan O'Connell: </B>Thanks, Dave. As Dave said,&nbsp;I've been in
this industry a very long time, and a lot of people, as Andy said, have talked about hydrogen, done studies. They've done demonstration
projects over and over and over. I sort of got tired of that in my last job, and so when I started American Fuel Cell,&nbsp;I really wanted
to move the industry forward. When Andy acquired the company to vertically integrate MEAs,&nbsp;I was really excited because Plug is where
they're actually doing things. I love working for Plug because we're actually doing things, and I hope when you took the tour last night,
you got a chance to see that this is all a reality, as Andy says.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">We are actually putting things into production, and we're putting them
into high-volume production, and we've established a team that's capable of doing that. It's really exciting to be here. Thank you very
much for coming. I want to walk through the numbers now. This is a 155,000 square foot facility. It's also capable of producing over 2.5
gigawatts output, and that's conservative. I think that's really on the low end,&nbsp;I think there's a lot more that we can produce out
of this building as we learn about economies of scale and really scale up the production material and move toward optimization and automation.
We're able to make 7 million MEAs here.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">This year, we've made over 3 million MEAs, and we continue to ramp
up. By the end or the middle of next year, we'll be up around 7 million MEAs. We also have the ability to make a little over 2 million
bipolar plates. If you were on the tour last night, you saw our revolutionary stamping process that allows us to stamp another plate every
two and a half seconds, so it's pretty impressive out there. Lastly but not least is we'll be able to make over 2000 megawatts of electrolyzer
at this facility on an annual basis.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">In addition to that, we have a contract with New York Power Authority
to bring green electricity from Niagara Falls here, and we turn that into green hydrogen through our electrolyzers. We have the ability
also to make 60,000 fuel cell stacks for all the different applications that Andy talked about, all the way from 5 kilowatts up to 125
kilowatts.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Dave: </B>And we have him on record saying that now, which is good
for Andy and myself. Dan mentioned this too, as we gain economies to scale, within the factories, we're really going to focus on how we
transition from starting up factories and really densify, automate where it makes sense, and really just build a world-class manufacturing
operation to improve quality, reduce costs, and really ramp the facilities, right?</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">This facility, specifically that Dan has built, provides us with a
template that we can mirror globally for as we expand, because as Andy mentioned, the demand is there, and we're going to have to do it
right? We want to maximize this, make this footprint as efficient as possible, copy this footprint with new technologies and take it all
over the world, which we're really excited about. Right, Dan?</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Dan: </B>We definitely are, and I believe that the innovation center
is our commitment to not only New York State, but to expand globally. We'll take this footprint and replicate it around the world with
some of our various partners to be able to produce everywhere we want to go. I think the [crosstalk]--</P>

is important, and we believe that everyone here believes what we're doing is important, and we're not going to fail, not only because
we have the right people in place and we have the a really smart team that's going to work their butts off to make it happen, but it's
too important for us to fail, right? Like, we're not just trying to do something to make Plug profitable, although that's going to happen.

when you took the tour to hear from them. They'll be available all day, so if you have additional questions, please let them know. I have
some great subject matter experts who just love to talk about the technology so please look them up and we can answer any questions you

every time you leave the conversation, you're like, &quot;I'm not as smart as I thought I was,&quot; so I highly encourage everybody to
talk to people from Dan's team, especially the subject matter experts that were on the tour last night. I'm having trouble with the clicker.
Well, let me just talk about this while I'm trying to get the clicker to work. This isn't the only facility that we're building in North

about 24 acres of land here at Vista Technology Park. The facility here is designed for manufacturing, remanufacturing service as well
as gives us the opportunity to bring in some stationary product manufacturing as well. Pretty large campus, certainly allows us potential
for future growth here. Material comes into factory in the north end through receiving into warehousing, through sub-assembly, and then
flows down our manufacturing lines, so we land in test and verification. Once we verify the product, we ship out to south end to the building

of the building, let's talk a little bit about the hydrogen infrastructure that will service this site.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Matt: </B>Sure. Behind us here, we have one of our larger GenFuel
installations, it's a 18,000-gallon liquid storage tank, cryo pumps, compressors, they actually have two skids in this installation, along
with a low-pressure, high-pressure vaporizers and storage tubes. That will serve both the manufacturing center for test as well as fill
up our fork trucks material-handling equipment we use inside the building and service as well. Additionally, we have landed location for
future backup stationary power that will help power this facility.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Chris: </B>Great. That's good to hear. We're so excited you could
join us today virtually for our tour of the Vista manufacturing facility. Hope you can join us in person in the future. Dave, back to
you.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Dave: </B>I'd like to point out that seven months ago that was dirt
and grass and you saw how much of that shell was built. We're actually starting validation and commissioning activities here in the next
couple of weeks and we'll be at full volume transitioning several of our products, if not most of our products that are currently in the
Latham manufacturing facility, in that facility in Q1 of this year.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">In less than a year, we'll transition from that facility to this facility
as a greenfield build at high volume. As we continue to build out our infrastructure, both from a manufacturing standpoint and from a
green hydrogen standpoint, we're adding jobs, we're adding capabilities, and we'll continue to add automation as we talked about, densify
our factories to make sure we're as competitive as possible globally.</P>

to our Gigafactory and Plug symposium, all of you that are here in person as well as those of you are actually joining us online here
today. God, when we first did our symposium in 2019, and when we're doing it four years later, God, it's so exciting to see everything
that has happened here, how far we've come along, everything we've done. By the way, even the things we've told you,&nbsp;I believe we've
actually exceeded some of those expectations.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Now, you've heard us say this many times before, and by the way, Andy,
thank you for that kind introduction earlier. Look, what are we really trying to do? What is our mission at the heart of it all? We are
trying to make hydrogen economical, we're trying to make hydrogen easy, and we're trying to make it ubiquitous. We are laser-focused,
by the way, in terms of execution, and that is going to allow us to become, and we're very confident about it, we will make sure this
happens, we are going to be the category king in this $10 trillion hydrogen economy.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Now, today,&nbsp;I am planning to provide you all,&nbsp;I'm very much
looking forward to it, an update on our vertical integration, how that's all playing out. I will provide you all with an update as well
on our build-out of the green hydrogen generation network, which is one of a kind, force-majeure resilient green hydrogen generation network
that we're building in North America and expanding into the Europe. I know this is near and dear to everybody's heart,&nbsp;I'm sure you
all want to hear about what does that mean from a P&amp;L standpoint, how are we going to make money, how we're going to generate cash
flow. Yes,&nbsp;I will talk about that as well.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Then finally, what does this Inflation Reduction Act mean for our green
hydrogen generation business? How does that change our business? Why we believe it is absolutely a game changer for Plug and for the green
hydrogen generation industry? Now, with that, just real quick on the vertical integration. As Andy talked about it earlier today, we've
made several acquisitions, and the best part about what we have done here is now there's not a single company in the world that can claim
this. You want to buy world-class electrolyzer, you come to Plug. Ole will talk a lot more about it.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">You want to buy the world's most efficient liquefier, you come to Plug,
and you will hear from Danny on this a little bit in upcoming video here. If you want to actually buy the best payload tanker on-site
storage, you also come to Plug, and that's what the acquisition of Applied Cryo Tech is.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">When you really think about it, we've now become a one-stop shop. You
know what the best part about this is? It's going to help us reduce the cost of our generation network, of our delivery network, but more
importantly, customer does not have to change their buying pattern. If they're used to buying hydrogen, we will sell you hydrogen from
our green hydrogen generation network.</P>

thing for us is, one, it reduces the cost, it helps move the economy forward, and the best part is the customer ends up getting economical
solution without having to change their buying pattern. With that, can we please play the video for what's happening in our Houston operation?</P>

of Process Technology at Plug Process Systems. We are now Plug Process Systems and the Energy Solutions business unit, and we build hydrogen
liquefaction systems. As the hydrogen economy continues to grow and evolve, liquified hydrogen will play a critical role in the storage
and transportation of the molecule. Compared to gaseous form, liquified hydrogen significantly lowers the cost of transportation for last
mile delivery and reduces the storage footprint at Point of Use facilities.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">We are focused on building hydrogen liquefaction plants that will help
reduce our overall costs of deliberate hydrogen to our customers. We do this by lowering the capital costs of our facilities and reducing
the required energy consumption of our plants. We have taken a standardized approach to engineering and fabrication and are currently
building liquefaction plants at 15- and 30-ton-per-day capacities with a road map to build 60-ton-per-day standard plants and larger.
We have a clear path forward for the next generation design to reduce the energy requirements by 20% while maintaining a robust and standardized
design.</P>

Cryo's manufacturing plant in Houston, Texas. Plug Cryo is a collection of industry experts and a leading manufacturer of highly engineered
cryogenic equipment used for the distribution, storage, and vaporization of liquid hydrogen.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Pushing the design envelope is also a key factor in liquid hydrogen
tankers with superior payloads, storage tanks with superior thermal performance, and overall, equipment that reduces cost. Behind me is
our liquid hydrogen trailer optimized for the continental US. It is volumetrically the largest liquid hydrogen tanker ever manufactured.
At the same time, it's the lightest liquid hydrogen tanker ever manufactured and offers unprecedented payloads over the road. An increase
in payload improves distribution efficiency and lowers transportation cost. Plug Cryo is currently exploring a multitude of expansion
opportunities. In the coming months, we will increase production capacity.</P>

about our green hydrogen generation build-out. As all of you probably have heard from us that we are very, very laser-focused on getting
our plant in Georgia commissioned by the end of this year. That is going to be the world's first green hydrogen 15-ton-per-day liquid
plant. We already have a gaseous hydrogen plant there that we're actually starting to commission and fill some of the low-pressure tube
trailers as well as high-pressure tube trailer. With that, why don't we go to the video of Georgia real quick here.</P>

of points I just want to highlight here. The foundation that is being poured, by the way, the liquefaction compressor, everything is already
in route there. It's not like we are waiting for this or there's any supply chain impact that's going to end up having any challenges
there. We feel very, very good about really getting this plant commissioning before the year is over. We'll be ramping up thereafter.
Now, beyond that,&nbsp;I'm sure some of you saw the press release that we put out this morning. We have finalized our partnership with
Olin. We've finalized the joint venture. That's going to be the next 15-ton plant that we're going to be building in Saint Gabriel, Louisiana.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Now, that is not like our electrolyzer and liquefaction, that's a feed
gas plant, but both parties are working together to make sure how you drive the CI score of that plant down to make sure that it is in
line with some of our other green hydrogen plants as well. Now, beyond that, another thing we've been doing is we're also working in Tennessee
where you all know that we have an existing running 10-ton-per-day liquid hydrogen plant. We're actually expanding that to about 15 tons
per day.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">We're adding another five tons of gaseous hydrogen there so that we
can support near-term network dynamics, which still remains somewhat challenging, frankly, until some of our plants come online, so we
can support a high-pressure tube trailer, we can really support all the force-majeure, and things like that that goes on in the industry.
Now, that brings me to one point, which is, look, when you add all that up, that actually gets us to about 50 tons of commissioning this
year, and I do recognize that that is below the 70-ton number that we've told you about, but a couple of things I want to point out here.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Number one, this is a very conscious decision on our part, by the way,
because we want to be a good steward of capital for you all because we had a path to do 20 tons per day of gaseous hydrogen, but we explored
that, looked into it, and it made all the sense in the world to abandon that gaseous hydrogen plant and do the liquid plant in those locations.
We want to make sure that we're being really, really prudent with our capital allocation as we're building this network and not just necessarily
focus on 50 versus 70 as a number.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Now, beyond that, we actually have had some permitting delays with
our 45-ton plant in New York. Substation permit finally got received in September&nbsp;of this year, that really delayed that project
by 12 months, but that's going to be in full steam ahead, and also consciously we abandoned two projects, by the way. These are infrastructure
projects, guys. We want to make sure that we're being very thoughtful about how we build them, how we spend money on them, how are we
thinking about return on our capital and return on our shareholders' capital. That's very important, so we also did not pursue those two
30-tons-per-day opportunity, one in Canada as well as one in Pennsylvania.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Now, the next one here is basically, despite all this,&nbsp;I do want
to remind everybody that we are absolutely on track to be commissioning 200 tons per day by year end 2023. Now, before I go into some
of the details on that, why don't we do a quick video on what's happening in Gateway. This is not necessarily my favorite part because
I get to see myself in two places. I find that bit odd, and that is one of my favorite parts of the job right now, going on site and really
seeing what's happening. It's so fascinating. It's kind of like your baby is growing and all the things are happening, so with that, let's
do a quick video roll on New York.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Sanjay: </B>You know, when we talk about green hydrogen, its role,
that in itself is so fascinating. This just gets you so excited, but when you actually come to the site and look at the infrastructure,
as you can see here right in my back, this is what I call green hydrogen at work and at work today. Not 5 years later, not 10 years later,
it is happening now, and we're making sure that it is happening now because it's mission-critical from so many different perspectives.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">When we're looking at the site this year, you actually see in my back
two of the large spheres being built, one of them is actually capable of storing as much as half a million gallon of hydrogen. Between
the two, it's about a 1 million gallon of hydrogen that you can store. Why does that matter? That allows us to actually have resiliency
with our plant, that allows us to manage ongoing maintenance, and that's very important to have that storage network to keep the plant
going from a 24/7 perspective, because that's what our customer needs. Where the construction is happening, that's where you will see
the loading dock go. That's where we're going to load all of our hydrogen tankers before they go to the customer site.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">What's going to happen is all the way far out to the site, you will
actually see mini-substations coming online. Then right next to that will be the rectifiers, that is going to drop the voltage down before
it goes into the electrolyzer house. In this site at 45 tons per day, we will have 120 megawatts of electrolyzer. By the way, that's coming
from our Gigafactory, which is only 45 miles away from here. This plant will power as many as 50,000 forklifts. This plant can provide
enough fuel to power 1,000 class A trucks.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">This plant will provide enough fuel to power as many as 7,500 light
commercial vehicles. The electrolyzer that I talked about is coming from our Gigafactory. We expect that to be here in the first half
of next year. Liquefaction is already going to be here by November&nbsp;of this year. It will actually arrive at the Port of Albany from
Europe. We fully expect the power distribution center to be here in first half of next year.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">As a matter of fact, we've done something that many probably wouldn't
do, we're actually going ahead and working in partnership with NYPA and National Grid to actually build a 500-megawatt substation. That's
going to be mega substation, if you would, and that is going to feed power into the STAMP site. Climate change is real. We must act now,
and that's what we're doing at the Plug. We're doing it today. It's here. It's real. We're super excited about this, and there's more
to come.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Sanjay: </B>All right, it's a good thing. I'm back on, on the stage
instead of the screen. Just a couple of points, if I may highlight, it's really a reminiscence of the industrial revolution when you think
about this plant in New York. As we lit up the city of Buffalo and transitioned from kerosene to electricity, that's what we're trying
to do here by going from diesel to green hydrogen, again, leveraging that hydropower from Niagara Falls some hundred years later. It's
so fascinating when you think about it from that perspective. Now, how do you get to our 200 tons a day? Well, first up, we can expand
our plant here in New York, the one that you just saw in the video, to 75 tons per day.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">We have the land, we have the design, we actually have the substation,
and we actually have had a dialogue with NYPA in terms of getting more power feeding into that substation that we're building in partnership
with them in National Grid. Second, we are actually building 45-tons-per-day plant in Texas, and that plant is actually, we're breaking
ground this quarter. All the permits are in place. We actually have all the long lead time items, that we've already placed an order as
well. That is going to be our 45-ton-per-day plant supported by renewable electricity.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">This is going to be backed by 345 megawatts of wind farm that is actually
about to get completed in that location. Now, another plant that we're going to be expanding is in Georgia. We have an option to expand
Georgia from 15 to as much as 45 tons per day. There is land there, there is power availability, which we have already gone through the
system impact study. Now, the only thing that we're trying to think about is do you want to optimize it to 30 tons a day or do you want
to actually take it all the way to 45 tons per day. Now, the next plant, we are going to expand Tennessee from 15 to 25 tons per day.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">When you then take all that consideration as we're exiting 2023 and
into 2024, we are going to be the world's largest liquid hydrogen generation company, no questions asked. Let me take you one step further,
not just that. As you think about 2025, we're actually going to be almost two times-- actually, more than two times bigger than the second-largest
company in terms of liquid hydrogen generation capacity. Another thing that we're doing is we're not going to stop there. If anything,
we're going to want to pull that in given everything that's going on in the market, we want to accelerate that substantially beyond 2025,
and I'll talk about that somewhere a little bit later here today.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Now, with all these learnings, everything we've done, we're also taking
this into Europe. We're actually working with a lot of different partners, and as Andy mentioned, Benjamin will talk a lot more about
it later in the day today, but we are looking to have about 100 tons of generation capacity in Europe sometime by 2026.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Again, making us a major, major player in that market on our journey
to get to that 1,000 tons per day by 2028. Now, what does this all mean? From a sustainable competitive advantage standpoint, first mover
advantage standpoint, folks, what we're doing here, frankly speaking, it's not an easy thing to do, it's very difficult, it's hard, and
nobody has done it before. We're trying to do this at the speed and scale that has never been done before either. When you really put
that into context, we believe that our first mover advantage, things we have learned. How do you scale electrolyzer?</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Ole will talk a lot more about it again later today. How do you really
think about optimizing the system design? The gas coming out of the electrolyzer going into the liquefaction, how do you think about optimizing
that? What is the best way to source water? How do you think about that? Can you get waste water? How do you optimize the sourcing of
that water in various different locations so that you can optimize and maximize that with where the right sun resource is, where the right
wind resource is and how do you really think about that.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Some of the things that we're doing are things other folks probably
haven't even thought about, frankly, as they go in this journey of building some of these plants. We believe these are going to be a major
competitive advantage for us going forward. Look, we're doing this in a time when labor prices are up, commodity prices are up. We have
had to deal with some major supply chain issues in the electrical infrastructure space. For example, the substation that I just talked
about.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">All these things we're doing it, and our focus and our strategy is
somewhat simple. You got to stay in nimble, you got to work with the right partners, you got to stay focused and keep on executing in
terms of doing what we're doing. Now, the next topic. I think all of you have heard about it. Let me give you a little preview on how
are we thinking about the Inflation Reduction Act.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">I know there's a panel here later today, you'll actually get to hear
a lot more about all the nuances behind it as well, but the most important thing of this Inflation Reduction Act, in our opinion, it's
a game changer. What it does is it makes green hydrogen economical versus every single form of gray hydrogen in the market today, period.
It will make green hydrogen economical in refining, it will make green hydrogen economical in green ammonia, both for domestic consumption
as well as potentially for export. It makes green hydrogen economical in methanol industry. That is already a 25,000-tons-per-day opportunity.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Now, with this PTC, another thing you'll also get is it improves the
total cost of ownership for all of our applications; stationary power, mobility power, which Jose will obviously talk quite a bit about
it later today. In summary,&nbsp;I think this is a transformational type of an event for the industry where the demand for green hydrogen
is probably going to be so much larger that the industry likely remains somewhat supply-constrained, and that's why we are doing what
we're doing here.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">By the way, don't forget, if we want to transition Class&nbsp;7 and
Class&nbsp;8 diesel truck into green hydrogen, that is an incremental demand of 200,000 tons per day. Numbers are big and we're just getting
started, and we are going to continue to accelerate what we're doing here. Now, let's talk about some numbers here. First off, what does
it mean for the payback of our green hydrogen plant? You've heard us say this before.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">In the beginning, some of the first plants, the payback is between
8 to 10 years. That's what we've told you. In some cases, that number could be as high as 12 in the beginning, 8 to 12 years, given the
world we're in, but with the passes of the production tax credit for green hydrogen, that payback will improve by at least four to five
years, meaningful benefit to the IRR of this plant. The second thing that is actually even transformational for the green hydrogen industry
and hydrogen economy as a whole is you're going to see major capital formation here. I know we have a panel here later today about that.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Some of you already know solar and wind industry is 20% equity capital
instead of being 100% equity capital funded project, what we're doing today is we're basically funding this hydrogen plants because we
said, &quot;You have got to get hydrogen right, you've got to get it done, and we're going to take charge to do that.&quot;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">We've been funding these plants with 100% capital, 100% of our own
equity capital, but with PTC, as some of these plants come online, what we think happens is you will at least get a four to five times
multiplied effect on that equity capital. As you see the capital stack change from a 100% equity, maybe down to 40% at first, probably
30% again, and down to 20%.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">This will follow a very similar pattern that you all saw in the solar
and wind industry in the last decade. The capital that we have allocated to build a green hydrogen network, we can probably use that money
and do four to five times more than, frankly, even what we've talked about before. Now, it'll be a mess if I don't touch on how does the
energy landscape evolve and change in light of everything that's going on. Some of the things we've been working on somewhat behind the
scene, if I may put it like that, we have been working on very large integrated renewable and green hydrogen plants.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">How do you think about hydrogen plants that are not even 75 tons a
day, 100 tons a day, but the plants that are going to be in 1,000 tons per day. We've got a lot of effort going on in dedicated hydrogen
pipeline and working with a lot of different partners on that front. We have a lot of work going on in long-duration hydrogen storage,
salt cavern, we've got a lot of work going on in that area as well. As you really think about this long-distance dedicated hydrogen pipeline
with mega hydrogen sites, what you're going to see is you are actually going to be able to move low-cost renewable generation from the
point of generation to the demand center. That will help stabilize the electric grid.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Then all of a sudden you'll see hydrogen become that solution like
Andy called it a Swiss knife, that is not going to only decarbonize transportation or industrial application, but it can also decarbonize
our electric grid as we think about the whole climate solution going forward. Now, as I said,&nbsp;I will tell you all about numbers as
well. Coming to the numbers, in 2023, with our merchant fuel as well as our cryogenic equipment business, we're looking at revenue of
about 285 million. We expect that revenue to get and approach almost 4 billion as you start to think about 2030, but here is,&nbsp;I think,
the best part,&nbsp;I hope you all will like.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Based on what we're doing, the build-out of our green hydrogen plant,
even with some of the existing industrial gas contracts, we are expecting to exit 2023 with an operating break-even performance in our
fuel business. That's been a drag for us for a very long time as many of you know, but that's what we believe is going to happen as we
exit 2023.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">I think that's going to be a big, big shift in our P&amp;L profile
for all of you as you look to numbers exiting 2023 as well as in 2024. Now, finally on the overall numbers, we're looking at mid-20% kind
of a gross margin for our merchant fuel as well as cryogenic business in 2023, but that number will be well above 30% beyond that as we
continue to bring these plants online, and I'm sure Paul will talk a lot more of that as well today.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Look, just to wrap it up, green hydrogen is here today. We're doing
everything we can, and we'll continue to do that to make sure that we are going to be the category king in this industry. We believe that
all of the learnings we've had to date, our unique industry positioning, and frankly, the balance sheet that we have allows us to execute
on our path to becoming a major energy company here in next years to come.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">With that,&nbsp;I thank you all for your time, and before I leave the
stage, it is my utmost pleasure to introduce my friend Ole Hoefelmann, who's going to talk a lot about all the amazing things we got going
on in our electrolyzer business. Thank you everybody.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Ole Hoefelmann: </B>Hello, everybody. Good morning, good afternoon.
I'm super excited to be here with you in Rochester and also welcome everybody that's connecting to us online today. I was at one of the
first symposiums four years ago as a guest speaker, and you already alluded to earlier, and thanks for the comment. I joined Plug about
a year and a half ago.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">What I shared with you a year and a half ago was, as Andy said, a team
that was about 20 people, and we grew excitedly over the last 18 months. What I'm going to discuss with you a little bit is the progress
that we've made. We had a lot of slides that showed you some designs, and I will show you that were all about actually getting things
done.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">When I was at the symposium last year,&nbsp;I explained to you that
we had a PEM electrolyzer stack that we acquired, which was the Giner ELX technology, as Andy referred to as the world's best, and I shared
with you some of the designs, some of the things that we're thinking of developing.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Really what we're all about is developing safe, reliable solutions
for our customers. Here you have the different setups of the 1 megawatt, the five megawatt and the 10 megawatt array. Our plan and really
what we executed over the last few months is to develop an infrastructure that allows us to deliver those things globally with skill sets
that we acquired over the last year.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">When you look at the structure that we put in place, Andy and I last
year met with various customers to understand what their shortcomings were, what they were expecting from the electrolyzer business, and
we understood that the technology itself, the electrolyzer stack was not the issue. What people were looking for is companies that could
be able to deliver world-scale solutions. At that time, what we ended up doing is we acquired a company called Frames. I think what's
important to understand is Frames is a systems integrator.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">This is a company that knows how to build solutions for the oil and
gas industry. What we ended up doing is acquiring them, bringing them in, and being able to set up our best solutions. What is important
is that the Frames organization has the skill set to develop products onshore and offshore. What I wanted to show you here is some of
the-- sorry guys.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">I'm having a bit of a-- What I wanted to show you here is that with
the Frames organization, we acquired a company that has a great skill set that allows us to build our electrolyzers out at scale. What
you see out front is a 5-megawatt module that we discussed earlier with Sanjay. Sorry,&nbsp;I'm having a hard time here. I apologize.
Let me take a quick break.</P>

is the basis that we use for our facility in Georgia. This is a facility that-- Sorry. Let me back up. We've built a 5-megawatt module
that we developed for our Georgia facility. Okay. Again,&nbsp;I apologize. I'm having a bit of a hard time today. Let me back up. The
team that we've structured is a team that allows us to build the 1-megawatt solutions that we have around the world. I think what's extremely
important to see here is that we last year showed you the design of something, that was a drawing, and today what you see here is something
that we've actually built and that we're getting ready to deliver at our test facility in the Netherlands.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">We've also built 5-megawatt enclosed system. This is super exciting.
What we've done here is we've developed 5-megawatt enclosed system that we've delivered at our customer site in Egypt. In order for us
to be super successful, what we need to do is we need to have a fabricator network, the ability to be able to build electrolyzers around
the world. What we've done is through the acquisition of the Frames organization, been able to build a fabricator network that we've established
around the world, and what you see here are the different locations already displayed.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">When you go and think about building an electrolyzer solution, what's
extremely important is that you don't only think about containerized and enclosed systems but you also start thinking about being able
to build plants. What we've been able to do here, and this is something that we do with our engineering partners, we're able to go to
our customers and talk to our customers about the plant solution that they want to have developed. What's extremely important is understanding
the customer's process, understanding how you integrate with a customer's process, and how you're able to then provide a solution that
addresses the customer's need in the end.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">What you see here is a design up above of about 100-megawatt facility
with our 10-megawatt array that you see on the bottom right. What I'm super excited to share with you is that we've done the world's first.
Again,&nbsp;I apologize,&nbsp;I was stumbling a little bit earlier, but in the end, what was extremely important is to explain to you
that we have the PEM technology and we have at this point also been able to build the skill sets to build electrolyzer units.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">What we've recently done is we've actually built the world's first
electrolyzer offshore. This is super exciting, if you think about it, what you're doing here is you have an electrolyzer that is on a
platform. Instead of having an electrolyzer sitting on the ground, it is on the platform, and it needs to be able to tilt 15 to 18 degrees,
and it needs to be able to overcome the elements.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Think about a platform in the middle of the ocean and you have waves
coming over that are three times as high as the platform itself. What we've done here is with our partner Lhyfe, we've created an electrolyzer
that is sitting on a platform that's connected to a wind farm and is in the middle of the ocean. Again, this is super exciting and really
important to think about.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">With the skill sets that we've acquired on the Frames organization,
they've understood how to do offshore. They've been working in offshore for years, and so what that allowed them to do is in the end develop
this solution here, that's really the world's first. What's important, and it's something that Andy alluded to earlier, when you think
about energy and you think about energy transition, what is common here is that you have different countries, different locations around
the world that are thinking about doing offshore.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">What's extremely important there is when you put the offshore further
out, bringing the electricity in through cables is not the most convenient way to do it and not the most cost competitive. What our solution
allows us to do, and this is what we're working with customers today that do platforms, that do FPSOs already, what that allows us to
do is produce the hydrogen on the ocean offsite and then transport the energy through the hydrogen onshore.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Here, you see some of the depictions of some of the announcements around
the world of offshore electricity, and we have one project that we're already working on in Denmark today, which is super exciting. Again,
when you think about the future and you think about the growth that we're trying to achieve, having the ability to do the offshore electricity
and bring it in with the electrolyzer is really a great opportunity for us, and we have the skill sets to develop that with our customers.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Andy alluded earlier to the fact that we have about a 1.5-gigawatt
backlog. I think what I wanted to show you here is that, and it's important also to the point that Sanjay was making earlier, when you
look at this, we're looking at different markets. When I originally got into this business about seven or eight years ago, it was all
about mobility. Really there was, by the way, you need green hydrogen, how do you get green hydrogen, and by the way, when do you get
it to be competitive?</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">What this allows us to do, the different markets that we have, allows
us to go ahead and scale up faster. When you look at the portfolio that we have today and the customers we're working with, you'll see
we have customers in ammonia, gas blending, e-fuel, biofuels, and obviously the mobility. What that allows us to do is obviously scale
the solution a lot quicker.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">We did recently announce a partnership with New Fortress Energy. What
I wanted to show here you real quick is we're working with them on 120-megawatt facility down in Texas. It's hydrogen that they're going
to use for industrial applications. I think the collaboration with them has been really, really good, and also the work that we've been
doing with one of the EPCs to, in the end, design a big facility.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">What you see over here is a design of what the facility would look
like. What I wanted to show you here again, is we have the 10-megawatt array that I shared with you last year, and then here is actually
where we're fabricating those arrays today. Again, we're making progress and we're working with New Fortress Energy on this application
which is green hydrogen that they're going to use for industrial applications to existing customers that they have today.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">I also wanted to take a quick moment to thank the customers and the
partners that we work with. Here the projects that we have around the world. As you see down below is the solutions that I shared with
you earlier. I think what's important to note is we're pushing the-- I would say at a speed pretty quickly. We're going very fast and
we have customers and partners that have the same pioneering spirits that we have, that are excited to work with us. I do want to thank
them because they're putting a lot of trust into us and working with us to help us accelerate the development of our solutions.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Andy alluded to the fact that we have a sales funnel that's about 25
billion which is really super exciting to us. I think, again, the important message on the 25 billion on the electrolyzer site is when
you look at the mix that we have today, half of the revenue that the funnel has is around ammonia. The other components that you look
at are around methanol and fuels. What that allows us to is, again, to scale faster and allows us to accelerate into the market a lot
quicker.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">What's also important for us is to have the skill sets to work with
our customers to understand those solutions for those markets. That is an important value that we bring to our customer, being able to
understand what their process is and how our green hydrogen fits into that. Oops, sorry. Go back.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">What was also important, and I shared this with you at the last symposium,
is that we wanted to ensure that we have competitive solution and in the end that we're driving down the total cost of ownership for our
customers. We continue to work on that. We do that in several ways. One is obviously we have the expertise to work on the balance of the
plant. We have the expertise that allows us to reduce the cost of the systems as we build things at scale. We also have the expertise
to change our design, to adapt, to look at what is competitively already out there from the oil and gas and some of the larger industries,
and then backwards integrate into how we tie that into an electrolyzer.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The other thing that we're doing that's important is we continue to
improve the performance of our stack. We continue to work on making the stacks. You saw the MEAs yesterday. We're looking at making them
thinner. We're looking at adding more cells to the stack that we have. We're trying to continue to work on it. What we're executing on
is being able to do more hydrogen production at a lower cost for our customers. That continues to be a key driver for us.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">I wanted to share also a revenue slide here with you. We have a strong
ambition for the electrolyzer business. Our objective by 2026 is to have a revenue of close to 1.45 billion and an installed capacity
of a little over 3.5 gigawatts. That's in line with what we shared with you already last year. Our ambition for 2030 is an in-stock capacity
of 20 gigawatt with a revenue target of 7.3 billion.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Again, a lot of ambition. Andy shared with you earlier, we have a sales
funnel of about 25 billion. Not everything necessarily is obviously going to materialize, but it certainly is an indicator of where we
can go and that we'll be able to execute on that. I talked last year about concepts. I showed you designs, and then I hopefully proved
to you that we have the designs and we know what we're doing. Although I wasn't really sure at the beginning when I started this presentation
that I was going to take that across, so, hopefully, that changed. It got a little better.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">What we have done, and I think this is important, we're working with,
in this case, McDermott, to do a concept design for 1-gigawatt facility. I think what's extremely important, again, is to continue to
think about scaling up. It's continue to think about the future, continue to think about modularity, standardization. I'm going to show
you a little video here. Again, the key thing is you'll see good concepts, good designs. I expect that they'll be different the next time
I am up here and share this with you, but what's important is that we are continuing to think big and that we're continuing to work with
customers to scale up.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Female Speaker: </B>Plug and McDermott have developed a 1-gigawatt
concept design that provides an adaptable framework to accelerate the development of green hydrogen plants. Scaling up hydrogen production
and storage are essential steps to meeting growing demand. With multiple gigawatt scale opportunities in play, Plug and McDermott engaged
to collaborate on a reference plant design built around Plug's PEM electrolyzers. The design unlocks multiple benefits by integrating
modular technologies and optimizing the balance of plant through standardization and centralization.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Plug is the leader in PEM Electrolyzer technology, and McDermott is
a world leader in end-to-end design, fabrication, modularization, construction, and storage. Each Plug electrolyzer array produces over
4 tons per day of gaseous hydrogen. The entire plant can produce more than 400 tons per day with instantaneous ramping capability to match
both the end-user demand and an intermittent renewable electricity supply. Hydrogen exits the electrolyzer at 40 bar, eliminating the
need for first-stage compressors.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">For reliable energy storage and to guarantee uninterrupted hydrogen
supply downstream, the plant includes the option to produce liquefied hydrogen. Plug liquefaction products coupled with McDermott's storage
expertise make storage and transportation of hydrogen safe and efficient. Plug and McDermott are enabling hydrogen at scale through standardization,
modularity, optimization, and safety of operation.</P>

When you go back, we have our foundational brick, which is the 1 megawatt stack. We have that stack that we're integrating into a 1-megawatt
containerized solution, a 5-megawatt enclosed solution. The 5-megawatt module that Sanjay talked about for the Georgia facility, which
you've seen earlier on the parking lot outside, and obviously our 10-megawatt array. The design that we then have with McDermott is all
about scale. It's about scaling up and being able to go all the way to 1 gigawatt and beyond.</P>

General Manager for the Applications Business Unit at Plug. Thank you for coming to our 4th symposium. It's incredible that we are already
on our 4th symposium. Today you have heard from Ole and Sanjay about the incredible things they're doing to create, generate green hydrogen
that is economical, is easy, and is ubiquitous.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">What I'm going to be talking today is about applications that actually
our customers can adopt to make use of this hydrogen and make their operations decarbonize and achieve their goals on sustainability and
their sustainability goals. Let me start with our material handling business. In our material handling business, we continue to provide
value to our customers with their productivity as we always do but also more than ever, next year in 2023 with our green hydrogen in sustainability
as well. This value is what has enabled us to grow in the year 2021 more than 40%.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">We are starting to reach a positive value proposition in smaller size,
around 50 forklifts or so. We're doing this by providing our customers with hydrogen infrastructure that is tailored for those type of
sites. In 2023, we will do that as well by providing our customers with green hydrogen that also is economical. This is going to allow
us to double our addressable market and it's going to propel our growth in the industry for the next few years.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">When we talk about material handling, the main question that you have
is, &quot;What's happening with pedestal customers?&quot; Well, instead of waiting for the question, today I'm going to be talking about
it [chuckles] during the presentation. Here, we have the impressive list of pedestal customers that we already have today. In the next
slide,&nbsp;I'm going to show you the customers that we're working with that are already signed or we have high confidence that will sign
as pedestal customers.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Grainger is a Fortune 500 company in the industrial supply business.
We have an MSA with Grainger and we are already working in several sites in 2022 already in engineering and permitting for those sites.
In Europe, we have been working for a few years and finally, we are looking at two big players in Europe, Lidl and Asda, two of the biggest
retailers in Europe. You will be hearing from them a little later in the presentation and it'll be quite exciting. You'll see.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Dave: </B>-&quot;We need this right away.&quot; We've saved about
31.5% of electricity costs and as a result, reduce greenhouse gas emissions. On average, we gain about per facility 5,000 to 10,000 square
feet of warehouse space that was once used to store those lead-acid batteries. Our real estate costs about three times the amount of a
dry warehouse. Every inch of that warehouse is very expensive, and to gain back that space is a huge driver for having Plug's fuel cell
infrastructure.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Jose: </B>Absolutely. How do batteries behave in freezer applications?
I don't know if everybody can see here, but those guys over there working in their factory, in their warehouses are wearing all these
jackets and all that because this is actually a complete building that is a freezer. Batteries in freezers, how do they behave?</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Dave: </B>We tested out batteries for years. The first year that
we have them, they almost go to waste. We have a problem. They never keep their charge, the warehouse operators don't take care of them.
For us, it was a huge thing to have. When that forklift drives seven miles per hour from start to finish as a battery, as the draw comes
down, the fourth truck goes at 4 miles an hour. Every second counts in our business to provide service that we provide to our customers,
to have that speed to market, for us, that's a huge thing for FreezPak.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Mike: </B>The sites we're building have a larger footprint and are
taller than ever before. Since we have such a heavy power requirement for these buildings because of the cold storage application, having
the ability not to bring additional power in for chargers is huge for us. Because of that, Plug will continue to be a part of our building
requirement going forward. As you alluded to, more sites.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Mike: </B>Getting our customers' product speed to market has always

ready to go in 90 seconds. I was astonished. I called my brother up and I was like, &quot;Dave,&nbsp;I don't care what this costs, we
are buying it.&quot; We were at that point in our career where we had to go three shifts. My dad was like, &quot;No, you can't do that.
How are you going to do that?&quot; I was like, &quot;We're going to do it and we're going to be successful at it.&quot;</P>

and we didn't know if it was going to work. It was tough the first year, but Plug always stepped up to the plate and was there for us
and still is. I know that we're confident that nine sites will be a blink of an eye for you. I call it getting out of battery jail. You

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">In Europe-- I'm going to now shift a little bit to Europe. The value
proposition for material handling is beginning to make much more sense than a few years ago. The main reason is when you think about the
energy environment that Europe is living on right now, and also the interest that many authorities are putting into hydrogen to become
one of the main vectors in the energy transition. In that environment, we've been talking for a few years with several companies, but
now we've been talking to two of the largest retailers in the European market.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">One of them is Lidl. With Lidl, we studied a project. We turn on a
site in April&nbsp;of this year. The results have been excellent. That feedback from their operations team has been really, really good.
We are right now at the moment talking to them about several sites in 2023 and 2024. Just as a reminder, Lidl has 13,000 stores and operating
30 countries in Europe and also operates here in the US. The opportunity with Lidl is pretty large.</P>

then adding to that, trucks for deliveries. We're going to be there with them. I can assure you that. Now, likewise, with Lidl, we started
a project with them at the end of 2020. The project went really well. We've been testing the technology with them. We've been trying the
technology with them for the last few months and the results have also been quite good. Lidl-- sorry, Asda is one of the largest retailers
in the UK.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">You're going to hear today from Frances who is the Material Handling
and Innovations Manager at Asda about how the technology has improved their processes as well as what are the plans for the future. Let&rsquo;s
roll the video for Asda.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Frances Spence: </B>Hi there, my name is Frances Spence and I'm
the MHE&nbsp;&amp; Innovation Manager for Asda Logistics Services. Asda&rsquo;s operating model is to ensure operational excellence is
at the heart of how we do things. Part&nbsp;of this is to minimize our environmental impact while also implementing solutions through
technology where the payback is strong or capacity requirements are greatest.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">You can imagine how excited we were at Asda when we were approached
by Plug Power to go to trial in Skelmersdale Chilled Distribution Center with the technology that we believed could achieve both of those
things. The trial started in November&nbsp;2020 when the traditional lead-acid factories were replaced by hydrogen fuel cells. The technology
was put straight to the test by COVID Christmas peak volumes at the project&rsquo;s most infant stage. Since then, the concept has gone
from strength to strength with colleagues on-site management fully on board with the technology providing positive feedback both from
an operational productivity point of view while also allowing the site to see a reduction in energy usage and overall cost.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Don't get me wrong. With any new technology, you will see teething
issues at the start, especially where colleagues need to change behavior or their routine. For example, colleagues went from manually
changing lead-acid batteries to parking their trucks at a hydrogen dispenser and filling up the fuel cell. However, with the training
and support, colleagues were able to quickly adapt to the new technology. We also benefited from the support seen from Plug Power and
their fantastic teams along with the onsite resident Plug Power engineer.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">We honestly couldn't be happier with how the trial has gone. It's allowed
Asda to get ahead of the UK retail market with innovation and given us the pride and the confidence in a technology which is new to the
UK and will provide Asda us with the benefits our operating model is built upon.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">It's positively changed the operation process. We've gone from colleagues
stopping partway through their shift to manually change batteries, which has taken precious time out the operation, sites using a considerable
amount of energy to charge the batteries, battery damage coming from colleagues handling them, and of course, lead batteries taking up
capacity in the warehouse. All of these things have now either been totally eliminated or significantly reduced as a result of hydrogen
and fuel cells.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Since the success of the trial in Skelmersdale, we are now hoping to
roll out hydrogen into a further 30% of the Asda network allowing some of our biggest distribution centers the opportunity to move away
from traditional lead-acid and be part of the fantastic new technology which will offer them benefits they would never be able to capture
otherwise. I look forward to continuing our hydrogen journey with this support from Plug Power. There certainly is an exciting time ahead.
Thank you.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Jose: </B>Thank you, Frances. Have you heard Frances is talking
about converting 30% of their distribution centers in the UK to hydrogen? 30% to start. I'll convince her to go further than 30%. Now,
we are going to be talking about our next major application for fuel cells, which is a stationary. We talk about a stationary a little
bit before. In the stationary market, we are deploying systems in different applications. Backup power generation, you'll hear a little
bit more about it from Microsoft. Green Power for EV recharging stations. That's an interesting one. I'll talk to you a little bit about
that one. Then finally, we are also doing prime power at utility scale. This is something that we are doing with our partner, SK in Korea.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">I want to stop for a second here on this application because this is
an interesting one and it was an unexpected application for our solutions. Many of our customers that have decided to go into EV fleets,
battery EV fleets,&nbsp;I should say, they are discovering that once they start going into their parking lots, into their depots, the
areas where they have their battery EV vehicles, they try to get the electricity to power those vehicles. Once they go over 50 vehicles,
100 to 150 vehicles, the power to get to, for those sites, is really difficult to obtain. It's either time difficult or is very costly.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">What they're asking us to do is they're asking us to bring a power
generator, which is what you see here on the right, is basically a fuel cell that is 1 megawatt to 5 megawatts that actually converts
hydrogen into electricity that we've been discussing before. Then with that power that is generated by that fuel cell, large-scale stationary
system, then we power the battery EV station.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">This is an unexpected opportunity for us. At the beginning, we were
a little bit skeptical about it, but we're getting more and more customers to actually tell us that the grid really is not ready to provide
all this electricity, especially in certain sites where you have high density, and they need alternative solutions. Those solutions have
to be green because otherwise there's no point of having battery EVs. There you have this application and we are expecting this application
next year to be one of the largest applications for a stationary. Now, when you put all those opportunities together, we have an opportunity
here. We've calculated an opportunity here of $350 billion alone in the US. If you look at it at a global level, the opportunity can reach
up to $2 trillion. This is why we were talking about this application specifically being a unicorn for Plug.</P>

backup. That trial or that test was described by Microsoft as a moon landing moment for the data center industry. That was not dramatic,
right? Also, described as mind-blowing that we have a generator of this size that actually has zero emissions. Darin and Scott from Plug
sat down with Mark Monroe from Microsoft to talk to us about what is the importance of this development in the data center industry. Let's

but the industry at large around the potential for zero pollution generation resources. Proving it could be done at scale was important,
and we did that over the last year. Seeing the project come together was really a great collaboration,&nbsp;I think, between our two companies

a key part of that. This demonstration in particular showed the potential for it.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Darin: </B>What are your thoughts on how you feel that PEM fuel
cells help achieve not only your sustainability goals but really ultimately your goal,&nbsp;I assume, to replace some of the carbon-emitting
solutions such as diesel generators in your network?</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Mark: </B>We, Plug Power and Microsoft, had to prove that the PEM
fuel cells could act as a diesel generator in terms of response time, startup, cold starts, the ability to accept load quickly. Those
are all the things that we verified as part of the development project that we did together.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Darin: </B>What's next for Microsoft and even longer term, what's
next for the industry as it relates to PEM fuel cells in your mind?</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Mark: </B>I'm going to say a little bit, but then I'm actually going
to turn it around. We've proven out the technology at a prototype scale. Now, what we need to do in our next step in our development typically
is now we want to test a marketable product that we can take and then start to build into our data center designs around the world. I'll
pass it back to you all. What does your next-generation product look like, and when can we have it because that's the next milestone?</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Scott: </B>We have a lot more granularity and a lot more modularity
built into the system. The system still fits in a 40-foot container. It'll hold up to 15 ProGen 125 units, but each one of them operates
independently and is controlled independently. The ability for us to control what the output of the system is and the efficiency of the
system and the operating point of the system are all much more flexible and designed to be able to interact not just with a data center
backup but all sorts of different applications that customers may have. EV charging and continuous operation, things like that.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Mark: </B>The next difficult thing, which is going to be, okay,
now that we've got a hydrogen-powered generation asset, how do we actually fuel it and use it in the future? How do we store that stuff
for long periods of time, which hadn't been really been done before?</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Darin: </B>We at Plug have really started to fill in those gaps.
That is with our ability to supply fuel with our green hydrogen network we're building. I think for you guys to get a comfort level across
multiple industries, you need to know that that supply is there, that that supply is green. I think we're bringing that to the table,
which really makes a difference.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Mark: </B>I just want to say thanks to the engineering team. Scott,&nbsp;I'm
sure we've done it before, but I express my thanks to your engineering team and the whole company that worked together to get this project
done. We couldn't have done it without you, and we're very excited for the possibilities going forward. Thanks, everybody at Symposium.</P>

It's great to have partners like Microsoft working with us on that. Actually,&nbsp;I was joking before about being dramatic, but it's
really mind-blowing what the team has done in this application. It's going to be the big application coming forward. Now I'm going to

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Andy asked me to be a little bit provocative on this segment, and I'm
going to leave you with a thought before I start talking about HYVIA. Just think about some people question about fuel cells being the
right solution for this type of applications like commercial duty vehicles and vehicles in general. Take a moment to think about how battery
EVs, battery electric vehicles would have fair in the unfortunate situation that we saw in Florida with Hurricane Ian a couple of weeks
ago. Think about having a battery EV and being in that situation and how before and after you will fair in terms of being able to regain
your mobility.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">With that, HYVIA. Only one year after we presented the first prototype,
we are now having production vehicles being built in Europe and ready to go on the road in Europe. Not only that, all these customers
here have shown interest and they will do pilots in the next few months with HYVIA. HYVIA's going to have capabilities to produce more
than 800 vehicles next year, and we are pretty confident that we will have homes for all those vehicles with these customers and more
to come.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">In the last week,&nbsp;I went to-- not last week. It was a couple of
weeks ago. I went to Flins to the factory in <B>[unintelligible 01:40:44]</B>, in Europe. I went with one of our largest global customers.
We tested the van and honestly, from my opinion was a really cool thing to do and pretty exciting. The customer was also extremely excited.
The customer is ready now to do pilots as well, and it's not one of the customers that you see here, so you'll hear more about that in
the near future.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Luca</B>: Hi everyone. Great things always start with great teams.
Teams that take challenges with passion. This is what is happening at HYVIA. HYVIA is a unique human and technological adventure. It was
born from Renault Group and Plug's shared willingness to embark on the road towards hydrogen mobility. For us at Renault, innovation has
always been at the core of the company. There was no question. To make mobility more sustainable and to achieve carbon neutrality, hydrogen
technology are key. We must take part in the race. This is what we thought. In today's automotive world, innovation is more and more about
teamwork. Complex problems require complementary expertise.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">That's why we teamed up with Plug and with my friend Andy Marsh to
create HYVIA, a hydrogen champion with a mobility champion sharing the same values, innovation, excellence, and courage. We are moving
very, very fast. In one year, the HYVIA team has achieved key milestones to build a complete hydrogen ecosystem in France. Recently, HYVIA
has been recognized by the European Union as one of the continent's major projects in H2 technology.</P>

excited to be at the HYVIA facility. Plug's been in Europe for over 10 years developing the fuel cell industry with some of our logistic
customers, and many of them are going to be customers of HYVIA. This was an idea that really came together as both of us, both Renault
and unplug, were committed to this energy transition.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">This was a deal that really was cut between myself and my friend, Luca
de Meo, about two years ago. Boy, what progress since. You look at it, we're not only building out an exciting vehicle but also the whole
hydrogen ecosystem. One thing Plug has learned, you have to have fueling stations, you have to have hydrogen, you have to have the vehicle,
and HYVIA can deliver it all. That's why I am so excited.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">I look here at this factory, we're already making products. This team
has gone from prototype to production in only one year. You got to be excited. When I take a step back, the exciting journey we're on
is really just starting. As we go ahead, is really is only just to beginning.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>David: </B>Thank you, Andy. Thank you, Luca. Our common objective
is indeed mobility decarbonization. HYVIA is a joint venture between Plug and Renault Group. Thanks for that, HYVIA is unique. Is unique
on the market because we are the only one to have the full ecosystem, the mobility, refueling station, hydrogen, and the electrolyzer.
All that with a very proud &quot;made in France.&quot; The hydrogen revolution is on. We are one year old and when we look back, it's
amazing what we have realized.</P>

It has zero-emission capacity, 400 kilometers range, and a very fast refueling time of less than five minutes. It's amazing. Look at the
product attribute. You have a very powerful fuel cell of 30 kilowatts with a large battery of 33 kilowatt-hour, this low, very long range.
You have also high pressure storage, 700 bar with 6.4 kilogram of hydrogen. Look at the cargo compartment storage. The payload is up to

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Jose: </B>Quite exciting. When we install the first application
with our customers, in general right now is material handling. Customers start looking at hydrogen as a key element on their energy strategy.
They've start asking us for more and more applications to complement that strategy and to start using more and more green hydrogen to
decarbonize their operations and attain their sustainability goals.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">One of those companies is Amazon. As you know, we signed with them
a 30-ton-per-day green hydrogen agreement in the summer. Now we are full steam working on getting applications around the material handling,
which was the first one to be able to use those 30 tons and beyond. Believe me, and beyond. We're going to have today, Dean Fullerton,
who is the VP of Engineering Operations, who has more than 30,000 people working for him, talking to us about those applications and the
plans for hydrogen within Amazon. Let's roll the video.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Dean Fullerton: </B>Thank you for the introduction. Hello, everyone.
I'm happy to join you from Seattle to speak about our partnership with Plug Power and how green hydrogen can help Amazon meet our sustainability
goals. Three years ago, Amazon co-founded the Climate Pledge, a commitment to reach net zero carbon across our operations by 2040, 10
years ahead of the Paris Climate Agreement. Decarbonizing our transportation operations network is key to us reaching this commitment.
Amazon continues to invest in a range of technologies because no single solution can fully close the emissions gap.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">This includes electric vehicles as well as alternative fuels such as
green hydrogen to eliminate the use of fossil fuels. Currently, over 95% of the supply of hydrogen is made from fossil fuels. However,
when produced using renewable electricity, hydrogen becomes a promising way to decarbonize industries not amenable to electrification
like aviation, steel production, heavy-duty trucking, and cargo shipping. This summer, Amazon signed an agreement with Plug Power to supply
almost 11,000 tons per year of green hydrogen starting in 2025. This is enough fuel to power 30,000 forklifts or 800 heavy-duty trucks
annually.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Amazon is proud to be an early adopter of green hydrogen, and my team
and I are excited to begin using the green hydrogen supply by Plug Power in different parts of our operations. We already have more than
70 fulfillment centers outfitted with hydrogen storage and dispensing systems, allowing us to start using green hydrogen to replace fossil
fuels. By 2025, we plan to have 20,000 fuel cell forklifts across 100 fulfillment centers, and that's just the beginning. Across Amazon's
operations, we're exploring and testing the use of other hydrogen applications such as hydrogen-powered trucks and vans in our middle
mile and last mile fleets.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Freight transportation is a difficult part of the logistics industry
to decarbonize. It presents unique challenges to electrification given the cargo size and long distances traveled. We're also looking
into fuel cell power generation stations as a way to provide electricity to our Amazon buildings. We are relentless in our pursuit to
meet our Climate Pledge commitment to be net zero by 2040. We believe that scaling the supply and demand of green hydrogen such as through
this agreement with Plug Power will play a key role in helping us achieve our goals. Thank you for your time today.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Jose: </B>No, thank you. [laughs] You just heard that, right? Material
handling is just the beginning. After that, we're looking at transportation, middle mile and last mile. We're looking at a stationary
for powering buildings. Exciting things are to come on the Amazon front.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Now, today,&nbsp;I gave you a summary or a review of where we are with
our material handling business. You hear from Lidl, you heard from Asda, and you heard from FreezPak on how they extract value from our
applications and our solutions. It is incredible to have customers tell us how they actually extract value from fuel cells. It's really
exciting to see how the growth of fuel cells is going to happen in the next few months.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">I've talked to you about a stationary and about the incredible opportunity,
$350 billion opportunity only in the US, and I've talked to you about on-road and what we're doing with HYVIA in Europe. All of that,
very exciting. I hope that also excited you about the great opportunities that we have for applications and for green hydrogen with Plug.
Now with that,&nbsp;I think we are going to go to a 15-minute break, so please be back in 15-minutes so we can continue with the show.
Thank you.</P>

thousand people joining us online live. Decarbonizing the economy is really the defining challenge of our times. The future is exciting
for a company like Plug as we just showed you, but the scale is monumental and massive and somewhat daunting. The US has faced large similar
challenges before, and Andy, you are a student of history. How do you see this?</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Andy: </B>Well,&nbsp;I'm also sitting here in Rochester, New York,
which is close to Buffalo, so back in the 1830s they built the Erie Canal going through this area and this became a real, real prosperous
area, and also really opened up the whole industrial Midwest. When you think about cities like Detroit, Chicago, everything that happened
there in the 19th century and the 20th century really started with the Erie Canal, and not to be exaggerate but eh, maybe a little bit,
when you look at the world today and look what happened with the Inflation Reduction Act, but look at what Plug's doing building out a
green hydrogen network across the US.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">I believe what we're doing in hydrogen is equivalent to building the
Erie Canal. That we're building out the capability for companies to decarbonize, for citizens to decarbonize, and ultimately continue
the US as a net exporter of energy, as well as support the US National Security for a long time, and that's really what we're doing in
this country and it's really what we're doing at Plug.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Preeti: </B>We got some help from the Inflation Reduction Act. There
are a number of fantastic provisions there for hydrogen. It came as a bit of a surprise there, a big surprise for most people but Erin,
you had an insider's view. What were the factors, the ingredients, how did it all happen? Give us your perspective on this.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Erin Lane: </B>Well,&nbsp;I will say from our perspective, it was
certainly not a matter of if we were going to get the hydrogen production tax credit, it was when we were going to get the hydrogen production
tax credit, and it was interesting because there were a lot of starts and stops when it came to what started out as President Biden's
Build Back Better legislation that he had started talking about when he was running for presidency. Then it was part of the Budget Reconciliation
Act, which is a way that only legislation can get done when there's one party that's in charge of all of the Houses. The Senate, the House,
and then the Presidency.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">This was a big piece of legislation that was a game changer when it
came to healthcare, energy, and climate. We thought it was going to happen, but really, there were a couple of starts and stops, so we
said, and even that summer, the president had come out and said he thought he was only going to do healthcare. Senator Manchin who had
a key vote had seen the inflation numbers, and he wasn't sure it was going to happen. We did have an insider view, and Andy had the opportunity
to testify in front of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee with Chairman Manchin. Andy, you remember when he asked you what
was the one thing Congress could do to put hydrogen on the map?</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Andy: </B>Yes, so I'm taking all the credit for this. [chuckles]
He turned to me and said, &quot;Andy, what do we need to do?&quot; I said what we needed was a production tax credit for green hydrogen,
an investment tax credit, and certainly for time. Erin, we did that, and then we had a great meeting with Senator Schumer, and look, there's
been no one who's better for this industry and better for Plug than who I consider the greatest senator in the history of the United States,
especially since he supports green hydrogen and fuel sales.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Andy: </B>I was in a meeting, and I'm there with the senator, and
I say, &quot;Senator, what's going to happen, and how much we really need this?&quot; He said, &quot;Andy, don't worry. It'll happen before
the fall.&quot; I walked out of the meeting with Jerry and Erin, and we turned to each other and said, &quot;This is different than everything
else.&quot; I'm also the Chairman of the Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Energy Association. We're having a meeting the day before the Act gets
struck, and we have high-power lobbyists who work for the Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Energy Association, going to tell everybody, &quot;Nothing
is going to happen. Give up.&quot; I said, &quot;I think you should tone down your message. I think it's going to happen.&quot; They said,
 &quot;Andy Marsh is always overly optimistic.&quot; [laughter] Actually, it did happen. Erin,&nbsp;I think you were hanging out in West
Virginia when it happened.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Erin: </B>It is a great place, and our new friend Senator Manchin,
we're really excited to work with his incredible team. We are jumping from the overarching Inflation Reduction Act to what was happening
on the hydrogen front but it is tied together for sure. Our champions really wanted to make sure that hydrogen was a key piece to whatever
was included in that package. We're really excited and proud about that because things have really changed.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Also, not to exaggerate or take too much credit, but I will say, Andy,
that it was years ago when you had really thought together about how we were going to put together a team and really figure out what that
game-changing technology or legislation could look like. I don't know if you want to talk about some of those partnerships just as you're
about to take a sip. Sorry.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Andy: </B>Well,&nbsp;I think that it does say a lot about Plug.
I hope folks see today, we're willing to partner with lots of folks, be it customers, whether it's people supplying us goods, investors,
they're all actually here today but we actually did the same. We worked very, very closely with <B>[unintelligible 02:22:49]</B>. We worked
very, very closely with Cummings.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">We worked very, very closely with people who are competitors but when
we had a common goal and mission together, as we do in the Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Energy Association every day, we try to find ground
that works for all of us.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Quite honestly, we supported some things in the legislation that wasn't
exactly how I would like it but it was how you work with others and make the greater whole come true is what we did as part of a team
effort to help this legislation get understood by Congress so that they would give it serious consideration to pass. It was a great journey.
Look, the journey continues. I think a lot of our efforts now are in Europe, right?</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Erin: </B>That's right.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Preeti: </B>Truly, truly an amazing accomplishment for the US. Erin,
but your work, you're busier than ever. Tell us what's on your plate right now.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Erin: </B>That is true, busier than ever. Once legislation passes,
that's really just a first step. There's a lot of things that need to be done, and when it comes to the tax credits, the Department of
Treasury recently put out a request for information to provide input on what some of those tax credits could look like, and it's way more
than just the hydrogen PTC. In fact, they'll probably be putting out another RFI very soon that's very specific to this but lots of work
needs to be done. Don and others from our team are leading that effort and so we're working hard on that.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">I also want to mention that it was a big year for us in the hydrogen
industry and that's really important to note. As Andy said, this is a collaboration. This is an industry effort that we're putting forth.
Last November&nbsp;there was a bipartisan bill that passed as well. Bipartisan Infrastructure bill and we're going to talk about bipartisanship
quite a bit, but in that legislation, many of you know, is $9.5 billion for hydrogen. $8 billion of that was for regional hubs across
the country that will be built out for the production, transportation, distribution, and use of hydrogen. We're really happy to be working
with a whole bunch of teams that are coming together to put in hubs applications.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">In fact, Department of Energy has recently asked for concept papers
and we work with those hubs and go Northeast Hub, <B>[unintelligible 02:25:19]</B>, and the other great ones that we're working with and
thankful to our hubs team. Then there was also $1 billion for electrolyzers to help bring down the cost of electrolyzers and manufacturing
of that, and $500 million for manufacturing and recycling for hydrogen fuel cells and such.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Also, the president announced the Defense Protection Act, which is
inclusive of fuel cells and electrolyzers. There's just so much that needs to be done to make sure that that legislation that was passed
and those priorities that are put forward are done in a way that is the most useful for our industry and making sure that we understand
the rules&nbsp;of the road of how to use them and how to move forward.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Preeti: </B>Andy, we now have the IRA, we know where the goalposts
are. What, in your opinion, are some of the top few challenges that we need to take on?</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Andy: </B>I always think about these things a little bit differently,
but what the IRA has done is really, the US is a demand-generated society, that's how you build businesses. If you think about everything
about how the US supported colleges, housing, a lot of it had to do with how do you create demand. What this Act does is really encourage
our customers to accelerate. We heard Amazon talk about their 2040 goals to be net-neutral. You heard from Microsoft. This helps accelerate
those activities.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">You have consumers who want to be green, companies that want to be
green, and look, the markets don't price externalities correctly so you really do need these incentives to really help scale these industries,
but also creates innovation. This is not only the gigafactory, but the innovation center and companies like Plug, and there's lots of
companies in the United States, who acts like this drive us to innovation, which is the best of who we are.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">On top of that, why did the solar industry take off? Why do so many
industries take off? The US has a unique position in the financial markets. I mean,&nbsp;I think Sanjay talked a little bit in his discussion
about how these projects will ultimately be financed. Our strength as a nation, policy that drives demand side, consumers who want goods
which are green, companies that are innovative, and a Wall Street that quite honestly provides the funding and capabilities to make this
all possible. I think whatever the government puts into this, they're going to receive back tenfold because it is going to generate business
today. It's going to generate good jobs today for a green world in the future. I really view this as an incredible win, win, win for the
country.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Preeti: </B>Andy, meet with a lot of customers all the time. In
your opinion, what are you seeing in terms of areas of capabilities that are going to see maximum growth and deliver the highest impact?</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Andy: </B>I think I've listened to everything today, and I think
my line is supposed to be the $350 billion Jose's talking about in stationary, which can help in data centers, which can help even the
EV of vehicles, the work we're doing with SK in South Korea, which ultimately becomes peaker plants here in the United States. Look, this
is going to drive green hydrogen, not only, the opportunity just for substitution and green hydrogen is just huge, when you just think
about fertilizer and refineries for fossil fuel. They can start their transition by going from gray to green.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Preeti: </B>We saw the curve that Sanjay showed show.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Andy: </B>Absolutely, Preeti, and look, Ole has deals about putting
hydrogen in natural gas pipeline, Sanjay has customers who want to do that today. I mean, this is an inflection point, and it's an inflection
point that we've been waiting for, for a long time. Our responsibility is really to take full advantage of it. That means to make sure
we deliver customers great products, but it also means that we continue to drive down our costs, and hear at Plug, every time we doubled
the number of units in the field, our costs have come down 25%. That's why scale is so important and that's what we're driving, and this
policy really helps us achieve that goal.</P>

Europe. What is the reaction to the IRA across the globe? What are you seeing?</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Erin: </B>It's interesting that you asked that question and I would
say that the IRA has definitely had an impact across the globe. I will say in some places, our friends and allies are excited to see the
United States take a leadership role in energy, but I also think that it's making some folks nervous. It's not as though people didn't
know that the legislation that was IRA was out there, but I'm not sure that people saw when it was going to happen and if it was going
to happen. It quickly turned the United States into a clear winner and leader when it comes to clean energy, particularly in the hydrogen
space.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Also, what's interesting is here in the United States we look at energy
policy and it's often tax policy, but other countries, especially in Europe, that's not how they drive, how they move forward a policy.
When we had some of the conversations with the European Parliament, they're really taking a look and trying to determine what do they
do that matches the incentives that we're doing which is not necessarily going to be tax. It's really an exciting time to see what not
only is happening here in the United States but around the world of how we are going to build that commitment to hydrogen.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Also,&nbsp;I think that there was a clear understanding that we in
the United States are going to be exporting hydrogen. We will be able to help fulfill a need for clean energy in a time when many countries
need that right now, but I think we're going to turn it over to Benjamin and he's going to tell us a little bit more about what's going
on in Europe. As Andy mentioned, he's our Executive Vice President in charge of EMEA.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Benjamin: </B>Thank you very much. I'm thrilled to be joining you
all at Plug Symposium today. The Inflation Reduction Act is not just about the US need. First, because the pragmaticism of the IRA influences
European policymakers to go for simpler, more effective rules. For instance, some rules&nbsp;around additionality or temporality in Europe
were drastically simplified following the adoption of the IRA.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Second,&nbsp;I would say that the inflation reduction app accelerates
Plug's European expansion plan. First, we now have two regional markets with strong regulatory support and subsidies, the US and Europe.
Second, companies like Plug will make the economics work much faster for green ammonia or green hydrogen exports from the US to Europe.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Europe plans to produce 10 million tons of green hydrogen locally by

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">This is a matter of energy security for Europe, of cooperation with
energy allies as you will hear from Minister Alexander De Croo. Plug aims to be this bridge between the US and Europe. This plant in the
Port of Antwerp-Bruges is the first building block, and I would like you all to hear directly from Belgium's Prime Minister Alexander
De Croo, and from Jacques Vandermeiren, CEO of the Port of Antwerp-Bruges why this first plant matters.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Alexander De Croo: </B>Ladies and gentlemen, secure, affordable,
and sustainable energy, that is what we need today. Firstly, we need to secure our energy supplies by ending our dependency on non-reliable
states and increasing cooperation with energy allies such as US, but also by producing locally together with partners such as Plug Power.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Secondly, our energy needs to be affordable. Reducing gas and oil dependency
makes us in Europe less vulnerable to price volatility. At the same time, investing in sustainable energy such as green hydrogen diversifies
supplies and reduces prices. Thirdly, moving to a low-carbon economy is a top priority. Hydrogen is a key factor to achieve this ambition.
Belgium has ambition to power Europe by offering stability to investors, offer a predictable regulatory framework, and provide the incentives
to transition to climate neutral economy.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Just yesterday we launched our renewed national hydrogen strategy at
an event gathering top policymakers, industry leaders, researchers, and innovators. Belgium, with a strategic location in Europe's industrial
heartland, is your hub for renewable molecules by promoting a robust hydrogen market, investing in hydrogen backbone infrastructure, working
in close partnership between public and private stakeholders.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">We play an important role in the local and international hydrogen economy
by facilitating the supply and production of hydrogen, distribution infrastructure, and transport of hydrogen to the end users in the
port and in the hinterland. As of today, the Port of Antwerp-Bruges is working hard to become the green energy gateway to Europe. In order
to realize that goal, we need to attract strong players in the energy transition to strengthen our port platform, and that's why we were
very honored when Plug announced in June&nbsp;this year an investment of &euro;350 million to establish a hundred-megawatt hydrogen production
plant in our port. This plant will produce about 35 tons of hydrogen per day.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Since this announcement, plants are being developed and the permitting
process has been started. We expect that by the end of next year, we can move towards the groundbreaking of Plug at NextGen District.
The presence of Plug in the hydrogen ecosystem of Antwerp-Bruges is just a fact and that makes us extremely happy. From Antwerp, Plug
will make an important contribution to shaping the hydrogen economy in Europe and we really look forward to the next steps and we reach
out to Andy, Benjamin, and their entire team to build on our lasting relationship in the years to come. I wish you an exciting event today
and I hope to see you all soon in Belgium or the US.</P>

inspiring true global energy transformation. The Port of Antwerp-Bruges is today represented by Philippe <B>[unintelligible 02:38:01]</B>,
who's at the symposium in person today. We are truly grateful for all your supports along the way. Let me tell you one thing about this
project in the Port of Antwerp-Bruges, without making any marketing or sales effort so far, we have built a funnel for as much as five
times the hydrogen volumes that our plant will produce less than six months after revealing our ambitious plan to the world, but we'll
not just sell hydrogen, there is more than 1,500 acres of color logistic warehouses in the port where we can sell material handling solution
or stationary fuel cells to serve short power opportunities.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Over the past six weeks in Europe, we also announced the sale of 15
megawatts of electrolyzers to life. We delivered the first electrolyzer to be commissioned offshore in direct connection with offshore
wind turbines in France. HYVIA promulgated its first fuel cell vans less than 18 months after the creation of the JV. You'll hear about
our first European pedestal customer in the coming weeks. That's something I'm very excited about. As we ambition to have our European
production capacities to account for a large share of plants global deployment of green hydrogen generation plans across the world, you
will hear more announcements in the coming months.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">More than business achievements we have today 10 times more team members
in Europe than two years ago. We'll have soon more than 300 employees in Europe. Plug is one of the largest employers of the Hydrogen
ecosystem in Europe. Erin, to your point, the IRA will help accelerate the adoption of the hydrogen economy in Europe by bringing us this
freshest decarbonized molecule. As Plug is set to play a central role in the European hydrogen ecosystem, we see Europe as one of our
uniforms. Unfortunately or fortunately, we have a lot of business going on in Europe and I can't be here with you in person today, but
I hope you enjoy our symposium, and team,&nbsp;I pass it back to you.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Andy: </B>It was important that we got the equation right in our
local market. I think we're a very ambitious group,&nbsp;I think folks can probably see that, but it's really important that we deliver
great products with great service at the right cost to our customers. We got it right in the United States and now in Europe, not only
are we doing certain things by ourselves, like at the Port, but we've gotten great partners like HYVIA,&nbsp;I think you see my friend
Luca there and I think what we're putting together is something really unique. I also think when you look at in Spain with ACCIONA, the
relationships that have been established there.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">You've heard about customers we're selling directly to, you've heard
about great partnerships, and there's lots and lots of activity going on about how we can help Europe become secure from dictators who
are trying to destroy the world. It's really important and I have some of my friends from the Atlantic Council here today who came to
hear about who've talked to us a great deal, how we can make sure Europe, United States work in partnership to make sure energy and we
have a secure future, and that's really what we're working at and that's what Plug is bringing to the equation.</P>

looking forward to hearing what Paul has to say, which comes right after this. I think George, we're between that numbers and what everybody
want to hear, right? What that, so thank you so much for coming. It's great to see you, and for those of you who haven't met George or
haven't come across some of the things he's done, George is the Vice Chairman for Lazard. He's the Global Head of their Energy, Power&nbsp;&amp;
Infrastructure business. I think under George's leadership, many of you probably use this Levelized cost of energy analysis for solar
and wind and what that has done, he's really the mastermind behind that, and that has become a de facto industry standard.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">George has obviously been at Sempra, he's been at KKR, he was at Cravath
as a partner, so when it comes to energy, power, and more specifically renewable energy industry. I thought that it'd be great to hear
some of George's perspective on how he sees the green hydrogen industry landscape unfolding, how capital formation might play out, and
what are the parallels maybe we can all draw from what has happened to the solar and wind industry.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">With that, George, maybe the first question here right, is help us
draw-- Look, when we first were looking at solar and some of the DOE loan guarantee program, where we're in the same organization, right?
It was very different times and costs were high somewhat prohibited. The PPS were much higher level, but today, solar and wind prices
have fallen as much it has. What would you say to people in terms of what parallel can we draw between what happened to the LCO of solar
and wind, given your experience, and where do you see the whole green hydrogen industry going now that we're all been talking about this
IRA and PTC and things like that?</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>George Bilicic: </B>First, thank you. It's great to be here and
the room is filled with optimism, and I don't know if I was on mic when I said to Andy what I thought about his presentation, but it's
just great. It's really inspirational but when everyone was fretting about where the legislation was going or not going, what we were
saying to people who called us about it was the most important thing to put in this legislation is something for hydrogen because it will
let the industry scale.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">We've woken up in the middle of a great American industrial policy
in some ways without us really realizing it. What we think is going to happen with hydrogen is, it's going to scale, costs are going to
go down, and the time frame for adoption, realistic adoption across the different use cases has just been dramatically accelerated because
of the Inflation Reduction Act.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">We do a quarterly series with CFOs across the utility industry and
we invite folks from Plug to this as well, and yesterday we did this session. There's a slide in the materials we gave the group that
shows by use case, just about every use case is acceptable from a cost perspective by the middle of this decade and earlier. Hugely important
and that's before you take into account the observation Andy made about-- I now don't quite recall it, but when we double the number of
units we have in the field, our costs go down by x.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Sanjay: </B>25%.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>George: </B>25%. We're going to see that and it's exactly what happened
in the solar industry. This isn't quite the right comparison and it's an imperfect comparison, but whatever you think about the German
feed-in tariff for the solar industry, it allowed the industry to scale and began the great costs down in the industry along with the
subsidies in the United States.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Sanjay: </B>George,&nbsp;I think Lazard played obviously a very
big role in terms of advising DOE on many things as well. There is lots of activity going on with the loan guarantee program, even for
the hydrogen industry. I think was that really the impetus if you were to get the back leverage and the project financing started for
the solar and wind? Walk us through the journey of how that played out. The folks from First Solar, and SunPower got some of the loan
guarantee program. Then now all of a sudden, solar is an investable asset class, gap structure had changed. Talk about that a little bit
as to how do you think it's all going to unfold.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>George: </B>I think the fellow running the loan program, Jigar Shah,
is incredibly thoughtful and passionate, he has a very good team around him. I think it is the equivalent of a lending institution's team
and will be very effective. There's going to be places where the capital is not quite ready to form, where the DOE can provide a wrap
or some support right now to allow the capital to flow so their capital is not necessary in the future. There is no need for subsidies,
for loan guarantees, or loan support in the wind and solar and storage industry, it's just happening. The capital is going to flow and
I think there's probably going to be some places where it's going to make sense for the DOE and other state governments, local governments,
to provide support.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Sanjay: </B>Okay. Now we are in a pretty interesting time as well,
the rates are rising. Maybe it's a short-term phenomenon, maybe it's a long term phenomenon, and obviously, you and Lazard obviously do
a lot of work with infrastructure funds, private equity funds. Has that changed their view on what is that equity return that they're
looking for? Maybe even for solar and wind? Is that going to end up impacting the cost of capital for green hydrogen build out? How do
you see that playing out?</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>George: </B>You can look at some recent transactions and it's as
if nothing's happened in the capital markets. We think cost of capital will go up but we don't think it's going to make a difference to
the energy transition and what Plug Power is going to try to accomplish. There was not a capital formation or a capital access program
around the energy transition, it's going to flow. The issue with the uncertainty with the legislation this year was really quite interesting
because people just needed to know what the rules&nbsp;were and put aside hydrogen for a moment but in solar and wind and storage, people
just needed to know what the rules&nbsp;were, and then the money was going to flow.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The problem with the uncertainty was no one knew how to price the investment.
We also said with the presidential election that we didn't think it mattered, ultimately, who was the president vis-&agrave;-vis the energy
transition because the human race is driving this thing and it's just going to happen.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Sanjay: </B>Okay, so you really don't think the rising rates is
really going to end up raising the rates or the equity return?</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>George: </B>Yes. It's going to raise their equity returns but I
don't think it's going to matter for projects and efforts that make sense. If the yield curve steepens, which isn't what the market is
predicting right now but if the yield curve steepens, people are going to plug that into the model, and cost of capital is going to increase,
but at the same time, the inflation reduction X, other developments, general acceptance of the energy transition across multiple areas
will offset that.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Sanjay: </B>Got it.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>George: </B>The infrastructure capital is incredibly interesting.
We just did this thing with Intel on behalf of Intel with Brookfield. Brookfield is putting $15 billion into a new fab with Intel. There's
going to be more of those sorts of things so there remains is almost a capital deployment problem if you've got the capital. We're just
not worried about this.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Sanjay: </B>That is good to hear because it's one of the question
I'm sure many of the investors here have in their mind, right, is the cost of capital going to really jeopardize the economics?</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>George: </B>I&rsquo;ll just make just one caveat which relates to
the last point that Andy was making, which is we're in an incredibly uncertain geopolitical environment. It is highly dangerous, incredibly
risky, so the caveat on all this capital access stuff is we have a situation in Europe that is almost unimaginable. We freely talk about
the potential for nuclear weapons to be used. There's a big geopolitical caveat.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>George: </B>We are delaying the publication of our LCOE this year

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>George: </B>Costs have gone up for renewables, but not as much as
other forms of energy, and we think that the cost profile of renewables will not go down at the same pace because they're so low already,
but they'll stabilize to continue to decline. We also think a lot of what's in the Inflation Reduction Act is going to get passed on to
the customer and get priced into projects. For a little bit, maybe a year or two, different projects will be more profitable, but the
competitive dynamic is going to compete the Inflation Reduction Act benefit out of the renewables generation space. Developers will drive
down to the returns they've been targeting as opposed to the returns they'd be getting if they were keeping all the Inflation Reduction
Act benefits.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>George: </B>That's not going anywhere, and the efficiencies continue
to be guarded around the costs that go into renewable generation, whether it's on through the EPC. Wind turbines continue to get better,
their ongoing solar efficiencies and integrating battery storage into these projects, particularly solar. Like, we don't even look at
standalone solar anymore because everyone's putting storage around it that's getting better and better too.</P>

believe we became one of the top 10 buyers of renewable electricity in Texas. When you talk to all the major energy companies, all the

It's not one thin, 10 things and we're going to need fossil fuels for a while, and they accept that hydrogen is one of those 10 things
and is growing in materiality and they're all trying to figure out the level of understanding of hydrogen is where people were 15 to 17
years ago on renewables when you're in the utility industry. Very sophisticated, NextEra, super sophisticated, but others I think still
trying to learn it and understand it and figure out how to deploy that for the benefit of the customer.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">There is zero resistance, zero resistance from the utilities to energy
transition stuff. The resistance that you find with the utilities is just around managing costs for ratepayers, which is an issue in this
industry. Then for the big oil and gas companies, this is adjacent to what they're good at. There'll be more and more focus on this area
and a desire to participate in this area. Also, people need to figure out a way, these pipeline companies, we got to figure a way to move
hydrogen around, so they're logical partners for you.</P>

time is the signal I'm getting from Teal here. Just to wrap up,&nbsp;I think cost of capital, despite the near-term environment, should
be okay. We will see capital formation with similar cap structure like what we saw in solar and wind. Now, do you envision a scenario
where there is a new energy giant that evolves in this whole ecosystem of wind, solar, everything that has happened? How do you see that?
Where does the utility fit? Where does a traditional energy company fit because it's a disruptive technology, if you would?</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>George: </B>I think companies that we think are leaders and will
continue to grow, NextEra is a very, very good company, very strong, very good new CEO. They are a energy transition super major. Total
is very committed to this. They're still in traditional energy, but their migration to and the energy transition will continue to grow.
I think that there are one or two other three other large oil companies who BP Shell all are&mdash;see, BP just bought Archaea yesterday,
the day before. I'm not sure, but there's going to be some others who emerge in the area that don't exist yet because the total addressable
market is so large.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Your total addressable market is enormous. It's not inconceivable to
see you filling up a large portion of that total addressable market. If you capitalize that future prospect and bring it back to today,
the market still isn't recognizing your value potential. The answer is I don't know but I think some of these big traditional energy companies
are going to fill this space because of the complexity of the projects. They need to be able to gather capital to take a lot of risks,
construction risk, and things like that.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Paul Middleton: </B>Thanks a lot, man. Being the CFO for Plug
Power is really difficult. I have to talk in forums like this about what we're going to do. I've got stakeholders here and watching
the video that are really interested about when we're going to make money. I got customers that don't want us to make any money and
I got my SEC counsel that doesn't want me to say anything. I have to figure out how to navigate all that, which is really, really
difficult but I'm going to do my best. [laughs] I want to share a little bit more insight on our financial outlook for the plans
that we've been talking about today.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">When you think about how big these markets are that everyone's been
talking about, the foundation that Plug has established, the penetration that Plug has already made, and the differentiated position the
Plug has and can leverage going forward, achieving our growth targets of 5 billion in '26 and 20 billion in 2030 seem very reasonable.
To support our growth, we have built a strong platform, which has helped us meet our financial targets. Why did that go forward? Oh, you're
moving it. She's adjusting my script here. You have to bear with me. That includes a broad foundation of technologies that enabled our
early adoption, deep relationships with multiple industry leaders, new investments that are expanding our geographic and industry footprints,
and a strong cost discipline that continues to drive down the total cost of ownership.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Last week, we shared some emerging headwinds in '22, where we could
possibly be 5% to 10% below our previous full-year guidance for '22, driven from some supply chain issues and some large projects that
may slide to '23. We're working hard to deliver our guidance that we had previously shared, but we thought it was prudent to share those
insights as they were emerging. What's important to note is even at the lower end of what we shared, we would still achieve 60% growth
year over year.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">As we sit today, our revenue forecast for '23 is 1.4 billion, and this
represents growth in a number of new markets and products like electrolyzers, stationary, power, on-road, green hydrogen, as well as growth
in our well-established material handling business. For '23, we also see progress in our gross margin and cash generation rate.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">This stems from near-term step function cost improvements. In electrolyzers,
for example, we will be increasing production tenfold over 2022 driven from substantial increase in direct sales, as well as for demand
or for our own green hydrogen platform. In fuel, as Sanjay conveyed, this will be a breakout year as we turn on the new green hydrogen
platforms and take advantage of the PTC credit.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">In service, we're seeing strong performance in new unit profiles as
well as all of the reliability investments we've been making in our legacy fleet. There's always many puts and takes to any forecast,
like actual volume rates, market conditions, and in Plug's case, noncash customer warrant charges. Given the fourth quarter 2023 forecasts,
we could end the year with a quarterly run rate and gross margin of 20% and breakeven ROI which would be a huge milestone and will be
a big milestone for Plug.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">As we looked at '26 and reaching 5 billion, we anticipate a continued
growth rate of 50% per annum, yielding over five times growth from today. For last year's guidance, at '25 at 3 billion, we now think
that that's probably going to be up 10 to 15%. Our outlook suggests that we're on track for and maybe even a little bit ahead of our path
for 2026. For 2030, we anticipate growing up to 20 billion given the rapidly growing pipeline. This top-line growth is complemented by
all the joint ventures that we're participating in, which we anticipate will grow and scale to as high as and maybe north of 20% of Plug's
wholly-owned operations.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Paul: </B>Although we're the only two without our hands up so it's
regarded,&nbsp;I guess. Backdrop in our growth forecast for a number of market tailwinds like regulatory accelerators that we've talked
about today, social poll, and total cost of ownership curves driving increased demand. The recent hydrogen legislation in the US is helping
accelerate adoption. We continue to see substantial support emerging from countries around the world as we talked about earlier. As you've
heard today, we continue to build on our foundation and expand our commercial relationships. It should increase our addressable market,
accelerate adoption, and continue improving our margin profile along the way.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Our 2022 has been an inflection point on many facets with new products
and new markets, but one interesting accomplishment and development has been Plug's geographic expansion. This year, over 25% of our sales
are outside the US, and we envision approaching in 2030, that it will be over 35%. If you factor in our joint ventures on a global basis,
we could have greater than 50% of our commercial success associated with activities outside the US.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Our team talked today about our specific plans to grow our varied markets,
and there are some commonality and themes. We need to build on our strong market channels and customer relationships, continue investing
in our capabilities, be flexible in our business models to improve market accessibility, and we need to stay focused on the maximizing
the customer experience. We have clear visibilities on these strategies and clarity on how to execute.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">When we look at our gross margin OPEX leverage, we should see growth
in both. This will stem from many factors. We're scaling our key capacity expansions which drive leverage. We've continually innovated
improving performance and simplifying designs. We've vertically integrated into key components and capabilities, and we've done it with
very nominal investment.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">We've built the global hydrogen supply chain and in doing so, collaborate
with partners to really reduce cost and improve performance. We've established the green energy hydrogen platform to reduce fuel costs
and accelerate innovation. Lastly, we have shown leverage on our cash OPEX base with managed and incremental investment prudently. We
expect these themes to continue as we move forward.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Taking a closer look at our gross margin roadmap, we used to have specific
initiatives to reduce cost and improve performance further. We've achieved historically a strong margin profile and equipment, and as
we scale, we plan to drive continued leverage and continued driving additional design improvements.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">On-service, really been about reducing parts costs and improving labor
leverage. We have improved our designs and maintenance procedures, which reduce parts costs. We've also more than doubled the number of
units to protect since we launched this offering in 2014, and we expect this trend to continue.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Now today on fuel sales, it's been mainly around pass-through activities.
The focus going forward as we've talked today is on leveraging our new hydrogen platform. In addition to this, we should see continued
leverage on our CapEx supply chain for this new business offering, which also benefits our direct customers, and that's the unique advantage
that Plug has. Since our focus from the start has been on green hydrogen with this platform, we're well-positioned to take advantage of
the PTC credit.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">As I mentioned, we expect to see step function improvements and '23,
and based on continued cost, discipline, and volume growth, we should see ongoing margin enhancement which can result in a margin rate
over 30% in the next 24 plus months. Given the high level of non-cash charges like depreciation, acquisition, asset amortization, and
customer worn charges, this should result in even faster growth in our operating cash flows. Operating income and cash flows really stem
from gross margin and OPEX leverage. As we grow the business and drive down cost, that should translate into positive trajectories for
both. Our growth forecast suggests we should achieve positive equilibrium on operating cash flow somewhere in the next 12 to 15 months,
and this will be another major milestone for Plug. Our base product and service business has historically not been significantly CapEx
intensive, relatively speaking, and we don't think that will change.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">It's the hydrogen platform that is CapEx intensive but fortunately,
as we just talked about here, with a previous panel, long-live infrastructure investments are very attractive to project financing partners.
The interest level that we've got have been increasing every year. This should collectively generate lower cost of capital solution for
us as we look to deploy and leverage these assets. I sit today with over 5 billion in assets and billions of cash, very well-funded to
fund our programs and our plans, and I also have very little debt leverage. As we turn these plans on next year, our plan is to leverage
them and circulate that capital to fund the future programs as we continue moving forward.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Given the megatrends in our market and the foundation, we have built
the clear strategies we've outlined, we believe our goals were '26 of 5, billion 2030 for 20 billion is very attainable. We've proven
the scale matters to improve operating leverage. Given our operational investments and capabilities and cost-down strategies, we were
equally confident our ability to improve margin and achieve our targets. Thank you for your time today. Hope that was everything that
you're waiting for to hear from me, and I think we're moving on to questions, Andy. Is that right? That's the next thing.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Ole: </B>Yes,&nbsp;I think that's a good question. As we look again
at the skillsets that we've developed and the conversations we're having with our customers, the question that I usually end up getting
is how does your technology compare with other technology? The way we end up winning is engaging with the customer on discussing really
the total solution and understanding really the customer's final operation. A simple example is when you talk to an ammonia customer about
their process, it's an industrial process. It's a process that runs continuously, and then you have the conversation on the electrolyzer.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The next conversation you have with them is around the energy profile
and understanding how does the hydrogen that I'm producing on the electrolyzer side feed into the ammonia process. Really the conversations
we're having with our customers are beyond simply, here's the electrolyzer, here's the cost for the unit itself. It's really the discussion
that we have and the engagement that we have on defining the solution with the customer. Today we've been very successful in a good product
of the market on that.</P>

across North America and also in Europe. That'll open us up while we also are focusing on building the entire infrastructure. We're looking
at doing what's best for Plug but it's also what's going to be best for the hydrogen economy overall.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Andy: </B>Yes, David,&nbsp;I think maybe, also maybe give an example.
I know with the electrolyzer work. There's a lot of examples in which you've been working on to bring suppliers up.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>David: </B>Our electrolyzer design is the first of its kind really.
We're working with some suppliers here locally in New York State. We're taking these designs that were the first of their kind, and when
really world class and we're working with the suppliers to increase their capability to make it easier for them to manufacture some things
that quite frankly, are difficult, but not impossible. Dan's feeling every day, and we talk about it every day.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">When we look at some of these core competencies, and what we're trying
to build out within the supply chain, it's both about figuring out what the next best thing from a technology perspective is, while also
being responsible and making sure that we're making the right choices from both a cost and scale perspective. Some suppliers up here in
New York State as far as <B>[unintelligible 03:15:05]</B> or <B>[unintelligible 03:15:06]</B>,&nbsp;I'm sorry, and some of the other GDL
suppliers outside of just Freudenberg to make sure that we're setting ourselves up to scale appropriately is what we're working on today.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Andy: </B>Preeti, what do you got?</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Preeti: </B>Andy, a lot of questions about the market being very
attractive for new entrants. Do we think that our integrated model will help us scale the business and build a durable competitive advantage
versus everybody else who's trying to get in?</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Andy: </B>That's a real good question. Maybe I'll duck that one
and let one of my team. When I think about it, the advantage comes from first the resources the company has put in place. Those resources
actually has a lot to do with the knowledge that's been accumulated, now, not only at their time at Plug but over the years. You heard
Dan talk. Dan has been doing this for 30 years. The knowledge base that we start from gives us a distinct advantage. I think the second
item is that I'm going to make a pretty bold statement, Plug has been pretty right over the last 15 years about what markets make sense,
and what markets don't make sense.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">We've made the investment, which I think we've used our resources wise.
I talked early in the discussions about thinking about the whole hydrogen ecosystem, and the importance of hydrogen, and then really green
hydrogen, and how we're using our investments dollars to really get a head start over everyone. That ability to think from a system approach,
not only from what we say, but I think today, you should have gotten a sense. We really know how to listen. We may have been right of
many things, but it's really we're right because we listen to great customers. Many of them are here today.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Arvind: </B>Yes. Thank you. I have two questions, actually. This
is Arvind Mohandrone from <B>[unintelligible 03:18:20]</B> Corporation. We are a supplier to Plug. Thank you for a great symposium. Maybe
first question for Paul. You talked about the revenue projections. Could you shed light on maybe the breakdown electrolyzers versus fuel
cells of that 20 billion in 2030? What do you expect?</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Paul: </B>Yes,&nbsp;I think we probably didn't do a good enough
job in the chart. We have a chart in there that shows that mix. I think what you'll see is over the '26 and on into 2030, green hydrogen
and electrolyzers are going to grow by and far to be a bigger portion of our business. That's really where the material handling and new
applications are going to grow substantially. I would say this,&nbsp;I'm going to preface it with this. It's unbelievable. If you go back
a year ago, none of us thought stationaries as I talk today was going to be as big as it's going to be. Our view on this could change
depending on how that market unfolds.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">When you look at it I think if you look at those projections, it goes
out, it's like 60, 70% of what those numbers are, even though those other base businesses are growing in terms of what we're seeing right
now.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Tim Cortes: </B>Thanks for the question. We've been spending a lot
of time in the last couple of years looking at our IP portfolio which consists of not only patents and trade secrets, but also the other
IP that's part of our business, particularly in manufacturing, right. There's a lot of IP that's not necessarily patents and trade secrets,
but how we operate, what our procedures are, how we actually build things, they're really critical to us. What we've done is we've actually
put together a team that actually reviews patents on a regular basis.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">We have a process in place where we encourage employees that are working
on technology and innovation to put forward ideas so we can actually evaluate and we really want to drive that portfolio patent as we
look forward. We're in the process of doing some economic value assessment of that as well, so we can understand really what our portfolio
mean to the enterprise. We've been doing a lot to try and spur that and drive that from an innovation perspective because that is one
of our cultural values at Plug is innovation. It's really important.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">I also tell my team technology without driving and being supportive
as a business just we're not going to do that just for technology's sake. It's really about how do we have solutions. How do we have economic
value and how do we help our customers solve their solutions?</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Sanjay: </B>Again, as I briefly mentioned, during the prepared remarks
earlier, we actually do have a lot of work going on, both on the pipeline, as well as on the caverns side. Now, we want to be thoughtful
about it because it doesn't make a lot of sense to just go and do a small distance pipeline two or four-inch diameter pipeline. You got
to really think about where the optimal solution comes into play because pipeline delivery, we compare that to how does that look like
versus doing the liquid delivery from an <B>[inaudible 03:22:40]</B> perspective, where the economic starts to change.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">We do have a lot of activity going on in the pipeline area. We're talking
to a lot of players and trying to think about who might actually and how many of them could potentially be an ideal partners for us. Now,
on the salt caverns, the same thing we actually have multiple partners we're working with, as a matter of fact, evaluating some real projects
and thinking through, are we going to look at salt caverns as energy storage solution to think about forming the grid? Is that going to
be somewhere where we think about a geological formation where you got a massive wind farm, massive 12-inch pipeline, moving a lot of
green hydrogen, then the salt caverns as a storage solution to form the grid create that resiliency?</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Again, salt caverns and a lot of stories for hydrogen is not a new
concept. It's been done before, there are some of those existing ones. Give us a couple of quarters,&nbsp;I think we'll be able to talk
a lot more about it in a lot more concrete way. I don't want to jump the gun but there is a tremendous amount of work going on in both
of those areas for us.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Andy: </B>It looks like we have another question from a long-term
investor.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Speaker 3: </B>How are you doing, guys? Congratulations on all the
successes this year. You've proven financial and business use cases with material handling with the larger warehouses, distribution centers,
Amazon, and Walmart, and those customers. Now you're looking at getting into the smaller warehouses. What might we see some of that revenue
stream coming in and how big of a revenue stream might that be? I think a lot of us are interested when we might hear something on the
class 8 side.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Andy: </B>I'll take the class 8. I'll let you handle the first one
and I'll take the class 8.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Sanjay: </B>For material handling,&nbsp;I understand the question
is when are we going to see revenues or the revenue stream for the smaller sites, right?</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Speaker 3: </B>Yes, sir.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Sanjay: </B>We are already seeing some revenue from the smaller
size this year. One of the mixes that we're seeing this year is that revenue account from non-pedestal customers is growing greatly, thanks
to specifically those type of customers that are smaller customers than they are doubling our addressable market. I'm expecting that next
year we will see even more so of that.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">One, because of new solutions, as I said before, that we have for those
customers that are smaller, more tailored hydrogen infrastructure solutions, but also because of the hydrogen that we are going to be
producing ourselves is going to be much more competitive and we're going to be able to penetrate much more those markets. We see already
some of that, it would be growing much more in 2023 and 2024.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Andy: </B>On the class 8 vehicles, we've been cautious. The relationship
you see out there with our vehicle with Renault is really the type of relationship we think about. Why does this relationship with Renault
work? It's really,&nbsp;I had one of our pedestal customers at the facility in France and we spent most of the time talking about not
just the vehicle, but how you service that vehicle, what the dealer network looks like for the vehicles.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">I don't think you can be successful in the vehicle market unless you
put all three pieces together. On top of that, we need your fuel. That's a real advantage. Everything we do is very, very thoughtful around
that. There are 40 specs that went out that have technology. Very few of those specs have that whole system. What we've learned when you
listen to us talk about the hydrogen ecosystem, we need a partner who can help provide the whole system.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">We can provide hydrogen, we can provide fuel cells. We don't have the
service network that can support that today. We don't have that dual network and those relationships at the local level you require. That's
the amazing thing about Renault. There are probably 200 people they're talking to about those vehicles that come from their dual network.
If a vehicle needs to be serviced, they know how to get it done.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">That's why that partnership works and any partnership we do has to
include that. By the way, every thousand trucks is about 35 tons of hydrogen. Well,&nbsp;I listen to the customer,&nbsp;I do that's it.
That's kind of how we view the world.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Erin: </B>Yes, just took off my microphone. Thank you. The good
news for us is that hydrogen is 100% a bipartisan issue, and we're really pleased to say that, experience has told us so. Also,&nbsp;I
referenced when I was talking earlier the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act that brought parties together. There may be a change in dynamics
in the house maybe in the Senate, and also we have great relationships. It's worked well for us in last couple of years. We've got Leader
Schumer who you talked about, also Congressman Morelle who represents Rochester area.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Congressman Tonko who represents our Latham facility, but we also have
great partners all over the country who are of both parties. When we were working on the investment tax credit for the fuel sales back,
when it was clear that both parties came together to fix the issue, they made a commitment to work together, and we're going to see that
kind of support as well. Andy,&nbsp;I want to pass it back over to you because you've had some really great conversations with Republicans
as well as Democrats.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Andy: </B>Hydrogen is not nearly as a quite honestly as controversial
as solar can be sometimes. If you really think about the kind of senators I speak with, they come from places like Louisiana where we're
building a plant, from places like New Mexico, from West Virginia, from Wyoming. These are traditional fossil fuel states. Hydrogen looks
a lot like what they do. Sanjay and I think George mentioned the importance of pipelines. If you talk to people like Senator Manchin,
pipelines are critical and create lots of jobs.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Probably one of the big difference about hydrogen versus some of the
other technologies is it does create lots of jobs, creates jobs in pipelines, it creates jobs and you see these trailers and delivery
of hydrogen. You see more people have plants to maintain them. It is a job creator. It also looks-- I made the statement and I don't know
if you caught it, about 25% of Plug's employees come from the oil and gas industry. We've transformed 300 people between the Netherlands
and India from being fossil fuel folks developing products to creating renewable hydrogen products.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Those skill sets are completely transferable and that's attractive
to fossil fuel states. When you're in the center from Kentucky's office,&nbsp;I won't say which one, they will tell you that they know
the transition's coming and they understand that hydrogen is much more natural transition for their economy than maybe some of the other
alternative energy solutions.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">By the way, they're also really smart. I'm stunned you're in it with
center of Cassidy from Louisiana is the difference between liquid hydrogen, gases hydrogen, green ammonia, green methanol, how they all
fit together. These folks really understand energy, they really understand hydrogen and it looks like we got another question.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Bridget Van Dorsten: </B>Hi, Bridget Van Dorsten with Wood MacKenzie.
Thank you for your presentation so far. Considering all of the gigawatt announcements that we see in the news, it was really wonderful
to see the study with McDermott that you did about the one-gigawatt concept facility.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">I was wondering if you might be able to speak to the economies of scale
that could be achieved when going from 120-megawatt size plants to one-gigawatt size plants, particularly with the balance of plant.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Andy: </B>You want to take a shot, Ole?</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Ole: </B>Sure, that's a good question. What I showed you earlier
today is that we were basing 120-megawatt system on the 10-megawatt array and that has an anode vessel for the hydrogen attached to it.
When we look at large plants and now imagine you're replicating that 100 times for a gigawatt facility.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">When we look at larger plants, we're looking at the array that we designed
and trying to see what could be moved off of that so that when you look at really the technology that we provide, the connection to the
stack itself it's minimal. It's really just the electricity and the water that gets to it. Then when you look at the outside of the facility,
let's look at pumps, let's look at gas treatment, let's look at the cooling side of things, and scale that up.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Today a lot of our innovation has been let's start with a stack and
work outward from there. When we now start looking and thinking of the next phase and that's why I said after the video,&nbsp;I'll be
back next year and it'll be different. We're already thinking about what do I have where I thought inside out that I need to be looking
from the outside in.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">As Andy was saying, we have a lot of people that come from the oil
and gas industry, there it's looking at what sizes exist already in pumps, in water treatment, in hydrogen treatment, and then work from
those out toward our stack. I expect you'll see that in a lot of improvement from that on the cost side.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Andy: </B>Sanjay, you may go because you made a statement about
gigawatt-size plants too.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Sanjay: </B>Again, just to add to what Ole said. Some of the other
areas where I think not even just the balance of plant, how do you even think about power supply? How do you actually think about standardizing
that? Thinking about getting the supply chain benefit for that. How do you actually also start thinking about rectifiers? Should you be
thinking about bigger than five-megawatt rectifiers because that's the largest you get from the solar industry right now? If you do a
10-megawatt skit, should we be thinking about what else can we do there?</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Then another thing that we can optimize and avoid with some of the
work that we're doing in our green hydrogen plant is the hydrogen duct comes out of the electrolyzer. It comes at 40 bars, so you don't
need the compression before it goes into the liquefaction. There are things that we can do. When you go from that 15 to 45 to 75 to then
again this gigawatt scale plant, it's I think going to be continuous progress with the balance of plant. We're going to keep learning,
we're going to keep optimizing and as you know, our goal is pretty straightforward, keep driving the cost down. That's what I would say.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Kevin: </B>Kevin <B>[unintelligible 03:36:01]</B> a quick question.
I saw the announcement about the Plug All-In-One. I was just curious about what the demand for that is or you guys are seeing potential
profitability that you guys see from that market.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Andy: </B>Plug all?</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Sanjay: </B>I got it. Sure. Again,&nbsp;I think we've been working
with Olin now for quite some time. Our plant in Tennessee is also where the Olin is our partner. We get the feed gas from them there.
Now, we're building this plant in St Gabriel, Louisiana. By the way, we're going to get this plant done very, very fast. It's almost a
replica of what we're doing in Tennessee. Now, we could sell out that plant completely today if we wanted to. We have demand for that
and the pricing actually is very, very attractive based on what the cost is going to look like. It will actually be in line with the gross
margin target that we have highlighted of 30%.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Now, one of the things that Olin and we are trying to do is the CI
score for that plant is not as attractive as the CI score for some of our green hydrogen plant. How do we collaborate? How do we think
about driving the CI score down so that we can also optimize production tax credit together for partnership? If that were to happen, if
we can really optimize that, the profitability if anything goes up. We don't need that production tax credit for it to get to that 30%
gross margin numbers. We could actually take that number up, and don't be surprised, as we said at the press release. Hopefully, there
is more to come. It's been a good partnership and we'll continue to expand that relationship.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Preeti: </B>Sure. Clearly, this goes back to a question that came
up which was what are we doing about smaller sites with smaller fleets? How do we make bringing hydrogen to the site more economical?
We've developed a product that has an electrolyzer that will be generating hydrogen onsite, and that helps with the economics for smaller
sites. We've announced the product recently and it was actually put in place because we had a interest from our customers. We're ramping
up, the interest is ramping up and we're getting interest from customers.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Andy: </B>I think it's a real interest. The question has to do with
the energy transition. I had the wonderful opportunity to meet with members of parliament at the EU. I was invited to have lunch with
the five members of the industry and energy committee. That was really the heart of the discussion. On the positive, there were representatives
from Germany there, they felt comfortable that the heating issue was going to be not a big problem this winter, but most of the discussion
was about how Plug could help build plants more rapidly. Especially, we had lots of discussions where you want to build in Europe today.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">We have the wonderful deal with ACCIONA, Jose, you can do solar at
$25 a megawatt that works. Benjamin has lots of activity going on. We talked to MPS from Sweden about using hydropower in northern Sweden
to bring that down into central Europe. Leveraging electrolyzers essentially at essentially very much like what we're doing in New York.
Finland has an incredibly aggressive plan about how to become a major energy supplier from Europe. Denmark you know we've met with them.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">I have some friends from the Atlanta Council here who we met with leadership
in Denmark, where they're looking to do 30 gigawatts in the Baltics as well as more in the North Sea with electrolyzers. That investment
is continuing. You heard from Benjamin when he was speaking, the Inflation Reduction Act really is also driving simplification in Europe.
I believe in Europe, what you're going to see is-- and you can see the northern tier, the Nordics in Europe are really aggressive about
how they become net exporters of energy using their wind power.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Places like Spain are looking how they become net exporters using solar
power and I think that equation works right. For the United States, a big opportunity, quite honestly, is that along with Chile, Australia,
we are the low-cost producer of green hydrogen and green ammonia. Europe recognizes that and expects to get half their needs from the
rest of the world.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">I'm being provocative here but Europe is beginning to understand they
want to depend on reliable partners, who are engaged with the same-- have the same national security issues that we have in the West.
I've lived through unstable regimes a number of times in my life. I remember 1973, waiting in line for hours for gasoline. 1979,&nbsp;I
had my own car then,&nbsp;I would go to my friends at night at gas stations, pay for it and get gasoline. Europe is going through the
same thing at a much larger scale today and there's a recognition. They can't be dependent upon these targets. When you have those discussions,
it's clear.</P>

term of 10 years, do you see a long-term effect after the term ends? If not, what would be the market in the US after the IRA finished?</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Andy: </B>I'm going to give my view. When you look at it, what's
our responsibility? We have a responsibility here to leverage the IRA, the scale and drive down costs. As mentioned earlier, that cost
is going down every time we double the number of units in the field by 25%. We have an obligation that leverages the scale to help develop
our suppliers to make costs in this industry lower. That being said,&nbsp;I don't have a crystal ball to 2033 but I would say this.</P>

to provide benefits that the oil and gas industry and fossil fuel industry receive today. The fact that they're polluting our air, the
fact that they're creating climate change the fact that they're impacting your health, all those items have a cost. We don't like to pay
taxes in the US, and we don't like to put those costs in. I would contend by 2033, those costs will still be real, and that there may
have to be when the world looks at it, some offsets to those costs that are happening. I look out now, beautiful trees, beautiful time
up here.</P>

guess, on margins here, can you maybe speak about the progression,&nbsp;I guess, specifically to the PPA and fuel business? What's driving
that improvement next year? Then also, going back to the prior outlook,&nbsp;I think 30% gross margins in 2025, 17% operating income that
really hasn't changed going into '26 despite the IRA. Maybe just talk about the pieces behind that. Why now movement?</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Paul: </B>Well,&nbsp;I want to say I undersell and over-deliver,
because I usually get yelled at when I don't deliver. If that's the case and our numbers. I would say a couple of things. On the fuel,&nbsp;I
think we talked today extensively about the fact return and all this new capacity. It's a dramatic-- I think this is probably one of the
under-recognized facts with our fuel proposition. It's going to be a dramatic differentiated cost structure for us. As we turn that on
next year, and we start selling that fuel, in addition to taking advantage of the PTC, it's a game changer.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">That's why-- historically, it's been such a drag on what we've been
doing, but when Sanjay says we're going to end the year at breakeven, it's slightly positive on the fuel basis. We still have a big legacy
portion that's winding its way through, but it's going to be a step function change. That's going to be a huge contributor. PPA is really
two things. It's service cost to services arrangements, which we see continues to come down.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">We've got situations where we've put in reliability investments, and
it's had a 70% part cost reduction at sites. We've put more resources than we ever have on reliability and improving the performance profiles,
and we're seeing dramatic changes. The other piece of PPA costs is the financing costs of those arrangements to be honest. We have seen
step function benefits from that, just moving back to the 30% ITC. Now as we move into next year, we think we could potentially go into
the 40% and maybe 50% and take advantage of those benefits in certain regions. That has a dramatic effect on our cost.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Another dynamic that has affected is some of those legacy arrangements
have wound down, we've been able to buy back some of those assets and now we're leveraging them into longer-term agreements and they become
cash cows. There's a lot of things moving in those pieces. In terms of the 17% for '26,&nbsp;I think, again, the main thing I would leave
you with is hopefully we've under undersold and we're going to be prepared to over-deliver.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Andy: </B>Thank you. For those who are here we had over 250 people
register, for those who are online,&nbsp;I really appreciate the time you spent with us today. One of our missions was to show you real
things. Lots of people talk about this hydrogen economy, talk about fuel cells. Plug Power does it.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Now,&nbsp;I think I started out this discussion by saying you walked
our gigafactory last night, you talked to experts, which you can't find anywhere else in the world in one building who are really deeply
involved in making the technology that we know how to implement lower costs and provide our customers better products.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">We do lots of things. You saw our cryogenic capabilities with the trailers,
you saw the electrolyzers, you saw the HYVIA vans. You also heard testimonies from our customers. People quite honestly like working with
Plug. I can tell you one of the things that I woke up this morning,&nbsp;I said to myself, &quot;What's so unusual about this event?&quot;
I had an analyst say to me last night, &quot;You're trusting us with all your customers around?&quot;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The answer is yes. We're the folks who want, who are going to lead
this transition, who as my friend Sanjay says, we are creating the company which is the category leader. It's important that all of you
help us. We need great employees. We need, we need great partners and many of our partners are here today. We need the financial community.
We're not afraid. We're willing to get us all together and help build something special.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Plug is a special company. I've been so fortunate to work here for
almost 15 years. I've worked with great people. I've watched great products being developed. We've had great people join us from other
companies. This is a unique experience and it's one that I hope you fully appreciate over the past few days. In summary,&nbsp;I like to
think that it's not like anybody on this stage except Preeti, did anything to make this event happen. My buddy Teal Hoyos over here, who
I've been with most of the last 14 years, Teal has actually done this four times for me.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Andy: </B>I've had great executive assistants over the years. Noel
de Petro and I've been at it, what, eight years now? Noel and she teases me. I interviewed her. I was wearing sweatpants and sweatsuit
when we interviewed for the job. Best EA I've ever had. Deeply involved in making all this happen. I want to thank you, Noel, thank you,
Teal, and thank all sorts of other people. I know Meryl's here and a large, large team behind Teal, Noel, and Preeti to make this all
happen. I think we're going to feed people again, right, Noel?</P>
