Completion of Convertible Notes Offering On May 31, 2023, Tilray Brands, Inc. (“Tilray”) completed its registered underwritten public offering of $150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 5.20% Convertible Senior Notes due 2027 (the “notes”) pursuant to an underwriting agreement, dated May 25, 2023 (the “Underwriting Agreement”), among Tilray, and Jefferies LLC and BofA Securities, Inc., as representatives of the several underwriters named therein (collectively, the “Underwriters”). In addition, Tilray granted the Underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $22.5 million aggregate principal amount of notes on the same terms and conditions, solely to cover over-allotments. The Underwriting Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants by Tilray and customary closing conditions. Under the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, Tilray has agreed to indemnify the Underwriters against certain liabilities. The description of the Underwriting Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Underwriting Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 1.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference. The above-mentioned offering was made pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-267788) filed by Tilray. The legal opinion of DLA Piper LLP (US) relating to the notes being offered pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement and the Common Stock issuable thereunder is filed as Exhibit 5.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. Base Indenture and Supplemental Indenture Tilray and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the “Trustee”) entered into an indenture (the “Base Indenture”) and a first supplemental indenture (the “First Supplemental Indenture” and together with the Base Indenture, the “Indenture”), each dated May 31, 2023, providing for issuance of the notes. The notes will bear interest at a rate of 5.20% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on December 15, 2023. Additional interest may accrue on the notes in specified circumstances set forth in the Indenture, including upon Tilray’s failure to comply with certain reporting requirements. The notes will mature on June 15, 2027, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. The notes are convertible at any time into shares of Tilray’s common stock, par value $0.0001 (the “Common Stock”). The initial conversion rate for the notes is 376.6478 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $2.66 per share of Common Stock), subject to adjustment as provided in the Indenture. The initial conversion rate represents a premium of approximately 12.5% to the $2.36 per share closing price of Common Stock on May 25, 2023. Tilray may not redeem the notes prior to June 20, 2025. Tilray may redeem for cash, in whole and not in part, the notes, at its option at any time on or after June 20, 2025, if the last reported sale price of the Common Stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price for the notes then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) and the trading day immediately before the redemption notice date. No sinking fund is provided for the notes. If Tilray undergoes a fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture), holders may require Tilray to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding the fundamental change repurchase date. The Indenture contains customary events of default. If an event of default (other than certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization involving Tilray) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee, by notice to Tilray, or the holders of the notes representing at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes, by notice to Tilray and the Trustee, may declare 100% of the principal of, and all accrued and unpaid interest on, all of the then outstanding notes to be due and payable immediately. Upon the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization involving Tilray, 100% of the principal of, and all accrued and unpaid interest on, all of the then outstanding notes will automatically become immediately due and payable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indenture provides that, to the extent Tilray elects, the sole remedy for an event of default relating to certain failures by Tilray to comply with certain reporting covenants in the Indenture will, for the first 365 days after such event of default, consist exclusively of the right to receive additional interest on the notes. The notes are Tilray’s general unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to all of Tilray’s indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the notes; equal in right of payment with any of Tilray’s unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated, including Tilray’s 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the “2023 notes”), its 4.00% Convertible Promissory Note due 2023 and its 5.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 (the “2024 notes”); effectively junior in right of payment to any of Tilray’s secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables but excluding intercompany obligations) of Tilray’s current or future subsidiaries. The Indenture provides that Tilray shall not consolidate with or merge with or into, or sell, transfer or lease all or substantially all of the assets of Tilray to another person (other than any such sale, transfer or lease to one or more of Tilray’s direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries), unless (i) the resulting, surviving or transferee person (if not Tilray) is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, and such corporation (if not Tilray) expressly assumes by supplemental indenture all of Tilray’s obligations under the notes and the Indenture and (ii) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture. The net proceeds from this offering were approximately $144.8 million, after deducting the underwriters’ commissions and other fees and estimated expenses payable by Tilray. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the notes in the offering, Tilray entered into separate privately negotiated transactions with certain holders of the 2023 notes and certain holders of the 2024 notes to repurchase approximately $12.5 million aggregate principal amount of 2023 notes for approximately $12.6 million of cash and approximately $122.5 million aggregate principal amount of 2024 notes for approximately $125.7 million of cash, which includes, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest on such 2023 notes and 2024 notes. Tilray intends to use the remainder of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes. The foregoing description of the notes and the Indenture is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Base Indenture, the First Supplemental Indenture and the Form of 5.20% Convertible Senior Note due 2027, which are filed as Exhibit 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3, respectively, hereto and are incorporated herein by reference. Share Borrow Facility In connection with Tilray’s offering of the notes, Tilray entered into a share lending agreement (the “Share Lending Agreement”) with an affiliate of Jefferies LLC (the “Share Borrower”), under which it arranged to lend the Share Borrower up to 38,500,000 shares of Tilray’s Common Stock. The borrowed shares are newly-issued shares issued in connection with the offering of the notes and will be held as treasury shares upon the expiration or early termination of the Share Lending Agreement. Certain purchasers of the notes may separately sell up to 38,500,000 shares of Tilray’s Common Stock that they may borrow through the Share Borrower. Tilray expects that the selling stockholders will use the short position created by such sales to establish their initial hedge with respect to their investments in the notes. Tilray will not receive any proceeds from the expected sale of the borrowed shares, but received from the Share Borrower a one-time nominal fee of $0.0001 per share for each newly-issued share of Common Stock issued in connection with the Share Lending Agreement. On May 30, 2023, Tilray issued 38,500,000 shares of Common Stock and loaned them to the Share Borrower under the Share Lending Agreement. The Share Lending Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants by Tilray and customary closing conditions. Under the terms of the Share Lending Agreement, Tilray has agreed to indemnify the Share Borrower against certain liabilities. The description of the Share Lending Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Share Lending Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference. The above-mentioned share borrow offering was made pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-267788) filed by Tilray.

Emerging growth company ☐ If an emerging growth company, indicate by check mark if the registrant has elected not to use the extended transition period for complying with any new or revised financial accounting standards provided pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act. ☐ Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. On June 14, 2022, Tilray Brands, Inc. (the “ Company ” or “ Tilray ”) entered into amendments to improve the terms of its previously-disclosed agreements to acquire from HT Investments MA LLC (“ HTI ”) all of the outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest under a secured convertible note (as amended and restated, the “ HEXO Note ”) issued by HEXO Corp. (“ HEXO ”). These amendments provide, among other things, for an additional discount to Tilray’s purchase price and that the conversion price of the HEXO Note be adjusted down from CAD$0.85 to CAD$0.40. Specifically, Tilray and HTI entered into an amended and restated assignment and assumption agreement dated as of June 14, 2022 (the “ Amended Assignment Agreement ”). Pursuant to the Amended Assignment Agreement, the purchase price for the HEXO Note will be equal to the outstanding principal balance of the HEXO Note as of the closing date (approximately $185 million as of the date hereof, and such amount at closing to be not less than $160 million) less a purchase price discount equal to 10.8% of the principal outstanding balance. The purchase price shall be payable by Tilray to HTI in the form of a newly-issued $50 million convertible note (the “ Tilray Convertible Note ”) and the balance, at Tilray’s option (subject to certain conditions and limitations), in cash consideration, Class 2 Common Stock of Tilray or any combination thereof. The Tilray Convertible Note will bear interest at a rate of 4.00% per annum calculated and paid on a quarterly basis. The Tilray Convertible Note will mature on September 1, 2023, unless earlier repurchased or converted. The Tilray Convertible Note obligations will be general unsecured obligations and rank subordinated in right of payment to all of Tilray’s current and future indebtedness to banks, commercial finance lenders or other lending institutions. The Tilray Convertible Note is convertible at HTI’s election in whole or in part at any time prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York) on the second trading day immediately preceding the maturity date into shares of Tilray’s Class 2 common stock, par value $0.0001 (the “ Common Stock ”), at a conversion rate equal to 125% of the closing price on the issuance date of the Tilray Convertible Note (the “ Conversion Price ”). The Conversion Price is subject to adjustment under certain circumstances in accordance with the terms of the Tilray Convertible Note. If Tilray undergoes a fundamental change (as defined in the Tilray Convertible Note), upon not less than 20 or more than 35 business days’ notice Tilray shall offer to repurchase for cash all of the outstanding obligations under the Tilray Convertible Note at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 105% of the outstanding obligations, unless HTI converts the Tilray Convertible Note in accordance with its terms. In connection with the Amended Assignment Agreement, each of Tilray, HEXO and HTI also entered into an amended transaction agreement dated as of June 14, 2022 (the “ Amending Agreement ”), pursuant to which (i) HEXO agreed to issue the amended HEXO Note to Tilray, (ii) the outside closing date for the transactions was extended to August 1, 2022, (iii) HEXO’s minimum liquidity covenant is reduced from $100 million to CAD$70 million, (iv) Tilray will have board governance rights to appoint two of HEXO’s board members and two observers and (v) the initial conversion price of the HEXO Note has been amended from CAD$0.85 to CAD$0.40. To the extent that the HEXO Note is acquired with Class 2 Common Stock of Tilray, the Amended Assignment Agreement provides for a post-closing adjustment, such that if the purchase price (less any amounts satisfied or to be satisfied in cash or the Tilray Convertible Note) divided by the daily volume weighted average price (the “ VWAP Price ”) of the Class 2 Common Stock of Tilray for the 44-trading day period following closing is greater than the number of shares issued at closing, then Tilray shall deliver to HTI in cash or additional shares, at Tilray’s option (subject to certain conditions and limitations), an amount equal to such difference multiplied by the VWAP Price. The issuance of the Tilray Convertible Note and the maximum number of shares of Class 2 Common Stock of Tilray that may be issued to HTI under the Tilray Convertible Note and the Amended Assignment Agreement were registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange ‎Commission under the Company’s ‎Registration Statement on Form S-3 (333-233703). Each of the transactions and agreements described above remain subject to several closing conditions, including receipt of HEXO shareholder approval; applicable regulatory approvals; and Tilray and HEXO having entered into commercial arrangements to achieve production efficiencies and cost-saving synergies. Copies of the amendment documents are filed as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3 with this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by reference. Item 8.01 Other Events.

On May 26, 2020, Tilray, Inc. (“Tilray”) announced that it will permanently shut down its facility at High Park Gardens, a licensed cannabis facility in Leamington, Ontario, operated through its wholly-owned subsidiary Natura Naturals Inc. (“High Park Gardens”). This High Park Gardens closure is a result of changing industry dynamics and evolving business needs. High Park Gardens will close its operations over the next six weeks and such closure is expected to be completed by end of July 2020. As a result of the closure, Tilray expects to realize annualized net savings of approximately $7.5 million (current production costs net of future third- party purchases and ongoing depreciation) and avoid significant ongoing capital expenditures. Tilray estimates that the closure of High Park Gardens will result in termination costs primarily related to severance of approximately $300,000 to be recorded in 2020. In connection with the permanent shutdown of High Park Gardens, Tilray anticipates non-cash charges related to (i) its property, plant and equipment in relation to placing these assets for sale and valuing such at their fair value less normal selling costs, (ii) inventory in relation to destroying of unharvested flower, and (iii) writing down to nil its intangible assets primarily related to the acquired production license. Tilray expects to recognize non-cash charges ranging from approximately $18.0 million to $28.0 million resulting from these write-downs and impairment charges in the second quarter ending June 30, 2020. Costs associated with closure activities are based on currently available information and preliminary accounting assessments, and reflect management’s best estimates; accordingly, actual cash costs and non-cash charges and their timing may differ from those stated above. Item 2.06 Material Impairments. The information contained in Item 2.05 is hereby incorporated by reference into this Item 2.06. Forward-Looking Statements In this Current Report on Form 8-K, all statements that are not purely historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and “forward-looking information” within the meaning of Canadian securities laws, or collectively, forward-looking statements.

Credit Agreement On June 30, 2023, Four Twenty Corporation (the “Borrower”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Tilray Brands, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), together with certain of the Company’s wholly domestic owned subsidiaries (the “Guarantors”), a syndicate of lending institutions from time to time party thereto (the “Lenders”), and Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent (the “Administrative Agent”). Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Guarantors have guaranteed the obligations of the Borrower under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement provides for a total aggregate principal amount of $75 million, consisting of term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $70.0 million (the “Term Loans”) and revolving loan commitments (the “Revolving Loan Commitments”) in an aggregate principal amount of $5.0 million (including revolving loans, swingline loans and letters of credit) to provide revolving loans (the “Revolving Loans” and together with the Term Loans, the “Loans”). The Loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the Borrower’s option, either (a) an “applicable rate” (as described below) plus the one or three month forward-looking SOFR term rate (subject to a 0.00% floor) administered by CME Group Benchmark Administration Limited (the “SOFR term rate”), or (b) an “applicable rate” plus a base rate (subject to a 0.00% floor) determined by reference to the highest of (1) the Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus 0.50%, (2) Bank of America’s “prime rate” and (3) the SOFR term rate plus 1.00%. With respect to any Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the SOFR term rate, the “applicable rate” is equal to (a) 1.75% per annum when the Borrower’s consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) is less than or equal to 2.50:1.00, (b) 2.00% per annum when the Borrower’s consolidated leverage ratio is greater than 2.50:1.00 but less than or equal to 3.00:1.00, (c) 2.25% per annum when the Borrower’s consolidated leverage ratio is greater than 3.00:1.00 but less than or equal to 3.50:1.00, and (d) 2.50% per annum when the Borrower’s consolidated leverage ratio is greater than 3.50:1.00. With respect to any Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the “base rate”, the “applicable rate” is equal to (a) 0.75% per annum when the Borrower’s consolidated leverage ratio is less than or equal to 2.50:1.00, (b) 1.00% per annum when the Borrower’s consolidated leverage ratio is greater than 2.50:1.00 but less than or equal to 3.00:1.00, (c) 1.25% per annum when the Borrower’s consolidated leverage ratio is greater than 3.00:1.00 but less than or equal to 3.50:1.00, and (d) 1.50% per annum when the Borrower’s consolidated leverage ratio is greater than 3.50:1.00. The Borrower is required to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the Revolving Loan Commitments in an amount equal to the daily unused portion of the Revolving Loan Commitments times (a) 0.30% per annum when the Borrower’s consolidated leverage ratio is less than or equal to 2.50:1.00, (b) 0.35% per annum when the Borrower’s consolidated leverage ratio is greater than 2.50:1.00 but less than or equal to 3.00:1.00, (c) 0.40% per annum when the Borrower’s consolidated leverage ratio is greater than 3.00:1.00 but less than or equal to 3.50:1.00, and (d) 0.45% per annum when the Borrower’s consolidated leverage ratio is greater than 3.50:1.00. The Loans mature on June 30, 2028 (the “Maturity Date”). The Borrower must make quarterly repayments of the principal of outstanding Term Loans, commencing on September 30, 2023, in an amount equal to (a) $875,000 beginning on September 30, 2023 through June 30, 2024, (b) $1,312,500 beginning on September 30, 2024 through June 30, 2026, and (c) $1,750,000 beginning on September 30, 2024 until the Maturity Date. The Borrower may voluntarily prepay, subject to certain minimum amounts and conditions, the Loans at any time without premium or penalty. The Borrower must prepay a portion of the outstanding Loans in connection with certain sales of assets, incurrences of indebtedness or casualty events. The Credit Agreement is secured by a first lien on substantially all of the assets of the Borrower and the Guarantors. Under the Credit Agreement, the Borrower is required to maintain, as of the end of each fiscal quarter, a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of not less than 1.25:1.00 and a consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of not greater than 4.25:1.00 through the fiscal quarter ended May 31, 2024, stepping down 4:00 to 1:00 for the fiscal quarters ended August 31, 2024 through May 31, 2025, and then to 3.75:1.00 for the fiscal quarter ended August 31, 2025 and for fiscal quarters thereafter. Additionally, the Credit Agreement contains other customary terms, including (a) representations, warranties and affirmative covenants, (b) negative covenants, including limitations on indebtedness, liens, mergers, acquisitions, asset sales, distributions and investments, in each case subject to certain baskets, thresholds and other exceptions, and (c) customary events of default and creditors’ remedies, including that, upon an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Agreement) that occurs and is continuing, the Administrative Agent may, or the Lenders holding a majority of the sum of the outstanding principal amount of loans and unused commitments may cause the Administrative Agent to, declare all outstanding borrowings immediately due and payable (such acceleration of all outstanding borrowings being automatic in the case of an Event of Default as a result of certain bankruptcy events). Additionally, the availability of certain baskets and the ability to enter into certain transactions are subject to compliance with certain financial ratios. On June 30, 2023, the Borrower borrowed $70.0 million of Term Loans and $5.0 million of Revolving Loans under the Credit Agreement to repay in full all outstanding obligations under and terminate that certain Credit Agreement, dated as of December 8, 2020, by and among the Borrower, the guarantors named therein, Bank of Montreal, as agent, and a syndicate of lenders (as amended, the “Existing Credit Agreement”), which was scheduled to mature on December 8, 2023. The Existing Credit Agreement provided for up to $100.0 million of term loans and up to $20.0 million of revolving loans, of which an aggregate principal amount of $65 million in term loans and $15 million in revolving loans were outstanding as of June 30, 2023. The loans under the Existing Credit Agreement bore interest at either (a) an “applicable margin” (as described below) plus LIBOR (subject to a 0.00% floor), or (b) an “applicable margin” plus a base rate (subject to a 0.00% floor) determined by reference to the highest of (1) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50% per annum, (2) Bank of Montreal’s “prime rate” and (3) the London interbank offered rate for deposits in dollars for the applicable interest period (subject to a 0.00% LIBOR floor) plus 1.00%. With respect to any loans under the Existing Credit Agreement whose interest was determined by reference to the “LIBOR rate”, the “applicable margin” was equal to 2.00% per annum, 2.25% per annum, 2.50% per annum or 2.75% per annum depending on the Borrower’s consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement). With respect to any loans under the Existing Credit Agreement whose interest was determined by reference to the “base rate”, the “applicable margin” was equal to 1.00% per annum, 1.25% per annum, 1.50% per annum or 1.75% per annum depending on the Borrower’s consolidated leverage ratio. The Company did not incur any early termination penalties in connection with the repayment of its obligations under, or the termination of, the Existing Credit Agreement. The Existing Credit Agreement was secured by a first lien on substantially all of the assets of the Borrower and the guarantors thereunder, and, upon the termination of the Existing Credit Agreement, all security interests granted to the secured parties thereunder were terminated and released. The Company used the net proceeds from the Term Loans and Revolving Loans borrowed on June 30, 2023, to repay outstanding obligations under the Existing Credit Agreement.

Merger Agreement On September 9, 2019, Tilray, Inc. (“Tilray”) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the “Merger Agreement”) with Privateer Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Privateer”), and Down River Merger Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of Tilray (“Merger Sub”). Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction of the conditions described in the Merger Agreement, Privateer will be merged with and into Merger Sub (the “merger”), with Merger Sub surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Tilray. The merger is intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the merger, each share of Privateer capital stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (excluding shares of Privateer’s capital stock held as treasury stock and dissenters’ shares) will be automatically converted into the right to receive the applicable portion of the Stock Merger Consideration (as defined below) and, if applicable, a portion of the Cash Merger Consideration (as defined below), in each case calculated in accordance with and as set forth in an allocation certificate as described in more detail in the Merger Agreement. The “Stock Merger Consideration” means 58,333,333 shares of Tilray Class 2 common stock and 16,666,667 shares of Tilray Class 1 common stock, in each case, as may be adjusted pursuant to the Merger Agreement; provided, however, that the number of shares of Tilray Class 2 common stock in the Stock Merger Consideration shall be reduced by the following: • the number of shares of Tilray Class 2 common stock issuable pursuant to certain Privateer options that will be assumed by Tilray (and which options will be converted into options to purchase shares of Tilray Class 2 common stock) (the “Option Merger Consideration”); • a number of shares of Tilray Class 2 common stock equal to the amount by which certain Privateer transaction expenses exceed $1 million, divided by the volume-weighted average closing trading price of a share of Tilray Class 2 common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market for the five consecutive trading days ending five trading days immediately prior to the closing date of the merger (the “Tilray Closing Price”); • a number of shares of Tilray Class 2 common stock equal to the amount of Cash Merger Consideration (excluding the Aggregate Cash Option Consideration, as defined below) divided by the public offering price of a share of Tilray Class 2 common stock in the an Offering (as described below) (less any underwriting discounts and commissions) (the “Stock Cash Consideration Shares”); and • a number of shares of Tilray Class 2 common stock equal to the option exchange ratio described in the Merger Agreement, multiplied by the aggregate total of all in-the-money options held by certain service providers of Privateer that are cancelled in exchange for a certain percentage of the Cash Merger Consideration (the “Aggregate Cash Option Consideration” and such shares, the “Option Cash Consideration Shares”). Tilray’s board of directors may, in its sole discretion, designate all or any portion of the net proceeds from an underwritten, at-the market offering, or other registered public offering of Tilray common stock or other offering of Tilray securities consummated prior to the closing of the merger (an “Offering”) as cash consideration for the merger (the “Cash Merger Consideration”), to be paid (i) pro rata in lieu of a portion of the Stock Merger Consideration to the Privateer stockholders who would otherwise be entitled to receive Tilray Class 2 common stock in the merger, and (ii) in lieu of a portion of the Option Merger Consideration to certain service providers of Privateer in exchange for the cancellation of certain Privateer options determined to be in-the-money, in each case, in accordance with the allocation certificate as described in more detail in the Merger Agreement. The sum of the Stock Cash Consideration Shares and the Option Cash Consideration Shares (together, the “Cash Consideration Shares”) shall not exceed 20% of the sum of the Stock Merger Consideration and the Cash Consideration Shares. Tilray is under no obligation to conduct an Offering or to pay any Cash Merger Consideration. Assuming no Cash Merger Consideration is paid in connection with the merger, immediately after the merger, (i) Privateer’s stockholders as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger are expected to own approximately 75.4% of the outstanding capital stock of Tilray and 90.4% of the voting power of Tilray and (ii) the three founders of Privateer, namely Brendan Kennedy (Tilray’s Chief Executive Officer and President, as well as a member of the board of directors of Tilray), Michael Blue, and Christian Groh (the “Founders”), are expected to collectively own 25.7% of the outstanding capital stock of Tilray and 71.0% of the voting power of Tilray. Mr. Kennedy, an executive officer and member of the Tilray board, is also the Executive Chairman, a member of the board of directors and the largest stockholder of Privateer. Michael Auerbach, a member of Tilray’s board, is also a member of the board of directors and a stockholder of Privateer. At the effective time of the merger, Tilray shall adopt Privateer’s equity incentive plan, and certain options to purchase Privateer stock shall be converted into options to purchase Tilray Class 2 common stock, provided, that as noted above, and as described more fully in the Merger Agreement, a certain amount of the Cash Merger Consideration (if any) may be provided in lieu of options to purchase Tilray Class 2 common stock. The Merger Agreement requires the Privateer stockholders to indemnify Tilray for certain matters, including claims relating to Privateer’s breach of representations and covenants in the Merger Agreement, allocation of the merger consideration, costs incurred with respect to dissenting shares, certain claims by Privateer securityholders or subsidiaries, equityholder matters, fraud, and pre-closing liabilities of Privateer or any of its subsidiaries, including pre-closing taxes. Tilray’s sole recourse for indemnification claims against the Privateer stockholders under the Merger Agreement (subject to certain exceptions, including with respect to any fraud claims) is the cancellation of Escrow Shares. The “Escrow Shares” will be a number of shares of Tilray Class 2 common stock equal to $125 million divided by the Tilray Closing Price. The first 50% of the Escrow Shares will be contributed by all Privateer stockholders on a pro rata basis based on each Privateer stockholder’s portion of the Stock Merger Consideration (the “Stockholder Escrow Shares”), and the second 50% of the Escrow Shares will be contributed by the Founders on a pro rata basis based on each Founder’s portion of the shares of Tilray Class 2 common stock allocated to all Founders in the merger (the “Founder Escrow Shares”). Indemnification claims will be satisfied first from the Stockholder Escrow Shares and then from the Founder Escrow Shares. The Escrow Shares will be held in escrow for a period of 18 months after the closing of the merger, subject to certain exceptions, and the Privateer stockholders will be entitled to exercise voting rights with respect to the Escrow Shares during the escrow period. In connection with the merger, Tilray has agreed to pay up to $1 million of transaction expenses incurred by Privateer. To the extent Privateer’s transaction expenses exceed $1 million, the Stock Merger Consideration will be reduced by a corresponding amount of shares of Tilray Class 2 common stock, as described above. The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants made by Tilray and Privateer, including covenants relating to obtaining the requisite approvals of the stockholders of Tilray and Privateer, indemnification of directors and officers, and Privateer’s conduct of business between the date of signing of the Merger Agreement and the closing of the merger. Tilray was formed as a subsidiary of Privateer. Privateer currently owns a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of Tilray’s capital stock. As a result, Tilray is a “controlled company” within the meaning of the listing rules of the Nasdaq Global Select Market. However, Tilray will cease to be a “controlled company” following the closing of the merger. In connection with the merger, Tilray expects to prepare and file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) a registration statement on Form S-4, which will contain a prospectus and a proxy statement seeking the approval of Tilray’s stockholders with respect to certain items, including the issuance of Tilray Class 1 and Class 2 common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement and the Tilray Restated Certificate (as defined below). In connection with the merger, Privateer expects to seek the approval of certain Privateer stockholders of the merger, the Merger Agreement, the conversion of Privateer preferred stock into Privateer common stock immediately prior to the closing of the merger, and the Privateer Restated Certificate (as defined below). The obligations of Tilray and Privateer to consummate the merger are subject to satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions including, among other things, (a) the effectiveness of the registration statement, (b) no law or order preventing the transactions, (c) approval by Tilray’s stockholders and Privateer’s stockholders, (d) the approval for listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market of the shares of Tilray Class 2 common stock to be issued as part of the merger, (e) antitrust approval of the merger and the acquisition of voting securities by certain individuals set forth on a schedule to the Merger Agreement, (f) the accuracy of representations and warranties and compliance with covenants of the respective parties under the Merger Agreement, and (g) the filing of the Tilray Restated Certificate and the Privateer Restated Certificate. The obligation of Tilray to consummate the merger is subject to satisfaction or waiver of certain additional conditions including, among other things, (a) no material adverse effect on the business, assets, or liabilities of Privateer, (b) the conversion of Privateer’s preferred stock into common stock, and (c) no more than 1.5% of the Privateer stockholders having a right to seek appraisal, dissenters’, or similar rights. The Merger Agreement includes certain termination rights for both Tilray and Privateer, including, among others, if the merger is not consummated on or before March 9, 2020, which initial deadline may be extended for 60 days by Tilray or Privateer if a governmental body has requested additional information or if the SEC has not declared the registration statement effective by at least 60 calendar days prior to the initial deadline. In addition, if Privateer stockholder approval is not obtained within 15 days of the registration statement becoming effective, and before Privateer stockholder approval is actually obtained, both Tilray and Privateer may terminate the Merger Agreement, in which event Privateer will be required to reimburse Tilray for up to $3 million in transaction expenses and the provisions of the Privateer Lock-up Agreement (described below) will apply. Prior to obtaining Tilray stockholder approval, under certain circumstances, Tilray may terminate the Merger Agreement in order to enter into an agreement to consummate an acquisition proposal that constitutes a superior offer, and the Tilray Board of Directors may change its recommendation to Tilray’s stockholders in connection with a superior offer or an intervening event. Further, Privateer may terminate the Merger Agreement in connection with an adverse change in the recommendation of the Tilray Board of Directors to Tilray’s stockholders. Under the Merger Agreement, without the prior consent of Tilray, Privateer will not transfer or offer to transfer any of the capital stock of Tilray. Support Agreements In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, certain stockholders of Privateer entered into support agreements with Tilray and Privateer covering approximately 35.8% of the outstanding capital stock and 45.7% of the voting power of Privateer as of date of the Merger Agreement. The support agreements provide, among other things, that the Privateer stockholders party thereto will execute and deliver a written consent with respect to all of the shares of Privateer capital stock held by them in favor of (i) the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement, (ii) the approval of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (iii) the approval and adoption of the Privateer Restated Certificate, (iv) the conversion of Privateer preferred stock into Privateer Class 2 common stock immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, and (v) other related matters. The support agreements prohibit transfers of Privateer capital stock, except for certain permitted transfers, including the permitted transfer of up to 10% of shares of Privateer capital stock held by the party thereto (excluding shares that will be converted into the right to receive Tilray Class 1 common stock) to any person who has not signed a support agreement, as long as such transfer is not part of a joint, concerted, coordinated, collective or group effort with any other person to market and sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of shares that are subject to a support agreement, and as long as the transferee executes and delivers a joinder to the support agreement. Lock-up Provisions The Merger Agreement provides that the Stock Merger Consideration and Option Merger Consideration will be subject to restrictions on transfer set forth in the form of stockholder lock-up agreement (the “Stockholder Lock-up Agreement”). The Merger Agreement requires each Privateer stockholder to deliver a Stockholder Lock-up Agreement. The Merger Agreement also requires each holder of Privateer stock options assumed by Tilray to deliver an option assumption agreement (which is expected to include restrictions on transfer similar to the Stockholder Lock-up Agreement). The Stockholder Lock-up Agreement prohibits the transfer of Stock Merger Consideration or Option Merger Consideration, other than in certain underwritten or other registered public offerings of Tilray Class 1 common stock, Tilray Class 2 common stock, or other offering of Tilray securities, pursuant to which, after the closing of the merger, the party to the Stockholder Lock-up Agreement has an opportunity to sell shares on a pro rata basis relative to all other applicable persons who held Privateer capital stock or Privateer options immediately prior to the merger, or following the closing of the merger, any other registered public offering, block trades, or strategic sales approved or arranged by Tilray, as well as certain other permitted transfers. The transfer restrictions under the Stockholder Lock-Up Agreement commence at the effective time of the merger. On the first anniversary of the merger, prohibitions on transfer with respect to 50% of the applicable securities will lapse (and all Cash Consideration Shares and other permitted sales of Stock Merger Consideration or shares underlying Option Merger Consideration will be credited towards and deemed included in such 50% lapse). On the date that is two full trading days after the public dissemination of Tilray’s annual or quarterly financial results for each of the four quarters following the first anniversary of the merger, the transfer restrictions with respect to an additional 12.5% of the applicable securities shall lapse, such that the restrictions with respect to 100% of the applicable securities shall lapse as of the second anniversary of the closing date of the merger. The lapse of the restrictions shall apply equally to each class and type of applicable securities held by the applicable party to the Stockholder Lock-up Agreement. The restrictions on transfer are subject to certain exceptions and carve outs, as described in more detail in the form of Stockholder Lock-up Agreement. The Stockholder Lock-up Agreement also provides that, in the event that Tilray grants any discretionary releases of transfer restrictions to any officer or director of Tilray or any holder of 1% or more of the outstanding shares of Tilray common stock, if the aggregate number of shares of Tilray common stock affected by the releases exceeds 0.5% of the fully-diluted capitalization of Tilray as measured immediately following the closing of the merger, Tilray shall send a notice to the party to the Stockholder Lock-up Agreement releasing the same percentage of applicable securities held by such party as of the effective date of the release. In addition, on September 9, 2019, Privateer entered into a lock-up agreement (the “Privateer Lock-Up Agreement”), pursuant to which, in the event the Merger Agreement is terminated prior to obtaining Privateer stockholder approval by either Tilray or Privateer for failure to obtain Privateer stockholder approval within 15 business days of the registration statement becoming effective, Privateer agreed not to transfer any Tilray Class 1 or Class 2 common stock during the period beginning on the termination date through and including the 135th day after the termination date. Amended and Restated Tilray Certificate of Incorporation As a condition to closing, Tilray shall have approved and filed the Tilray Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (as amended, the “Tilray Restated Certificate”). Pursuant to the Tilray Restated Certificate, each share of Tilray Class 1 common stock is convertible at any time at the option of the holder into one share of Class 2 common stock. In addition, each share of Class 1 common stock will automatically convert into one share of Class 2 common stock upon any transfer, whether or not for value and whether voluntary or involuntary or by operation of law, except for certain transfers described in the Tilray Restated Certificate, including certain transfers for tax and estate planning purposes. The Tilray Restated Certificate will eliminate the exception for transfers among Founders, including the exception for the entry into certain voting arrangements among Founders. Upon the date on which the outstanding shares of Class 1 common stock represent less than 10% of the aggregate number of shares of Class 1 common stock and Class 2 common stock then outstanding, all outstanding shares of Class 1 common stock shall convert automatically into shares of Class 2 common stock, and no additional shares of Class 1 common stock will be issued. Amended and Restated Privateer Certificate of Incorporation As a condition to closing, Privateer shall amend its certificate of incorporation (as amended, the “Privateer Restated Certificate”). The Privateer Restated Certificate provides that with respect to the Stock Merger Consideration: (a) to the maximum extent possible, the shares of Tilray Class 1 common stock will allocated pro rata among the Founders, with the Founders receiving the remainder of their Stock Merger Consideration in the form of shares of Tilray Class 2 common stock, and (b) to the maximum extent possible, the non-Founder stockholders will receive shares of Tilray Class 2 common stock (with the intent of eliminating or minimizing the Tilray Class 1 common stock that could otherwise have been distributed to any non-Founder stockholder in connection with the merger). The Privateer Restated Certificate provides that with respect to the Cash Merger Consideration, if any, such cash payment shall be allocated among the recipients of shares of Tilray Class 1 common stock and Tilray Class 2 common stock in proportion to the number of shares of Class 1 common stock and Tilray Class 2 common stock allocated to such recipient, after giving effect to the priority allocation of Class 1 common stock to the Founder stockholders. As described above, under the Merger Agreement, Cash Merger Consideration may be paid in lieu of issuing a portion of shares of Tilray Class 2 common stock to be issued as Stock Merger Consideration. The foregoing descriptions of the Merger Agreement (including the forms of the Tilray Restated Certificate, the Privateer Restated Certificate, the Stockholder Lock-Up Agreements and the support agreement attached as exhibits to the Merger Agreement) and the Privateer Lock-Up Agreement are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to those agreements or the forms thereof, as applicable, which are attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4, respectively, to this report and incorporated herein by reference. The Merger Agreement (and the foregoing description of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby) has been included to provide investors and stockholders with information regarding the terms of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about Tilray or Privateer. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Merger Agreement were made only as of specified dates for the purposes of the Merger Agreement, were solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement and may be subject to qualifications and limitations agreed upon by such parties. In particular, in reviewing the representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Merger Agreement and discussed in the foregoing description, it is important to bear in mind that such representations, warranties and covenants were negotiated with the principal purpose of allocating risk between the parties, rather than establishing matters as facts. Such representations, warranties and covenants may also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable to stockholders and reports and documents filed with the SEC. Investors and stockholders are not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement. Accordingly, investors and stockholders should not rely on such representations, warranties and covenants as characterizations of the actual state of facts or circumstances described therein. Information concerning the subject matter of such representations, warranties and covenants may change after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the parties’ public disclosures. Item 8.01 Other Events. On September 9, 2019, Tilray and Privateer issued a joint press release announcing the execution of the Merger Agreement. The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. Forward Looking Statements This report and the press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and “forward-looking information” within the meaning of Canadian securities laws, or collectively, forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements in this press release may be identified by the use of words such as, “may”, “would”, “could”, “will”, “likely”, “expect”, “anticipate”, “believe”, “intend”, “plan”, “forecast”, “project”, “estimate”, “outlook” and other similar expressions, including statements in respect to Tilray and the consummation of the merger. Forward-looking statements are not a guarantee of future performance and are based upon a number of estimates and assumptions of management in light of management’s experience and perception of trends, current conditions and expected developments, as well as other factors that management believes to be relevant and reasonable in the circumstances, including assumptions in respect of current and future market conditions, the current and future regulatory environment and future approvals and permits. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements as a result of these risks and uncertainties, which include, but are not limited to: (i) risk that the conditions to the closing of the merger are not satisfied, including the failure to timely obtain stockholder approval for the transaction from each of Tilray’s and Privateer’s stockholders, if at all; (ii) uncertainties as to the timing of the consummation of the proposed merger and the ability of each of Tilray and Privateer to consummate the proposed merger; (iii) risks related to the diversion of management’s attention from Tilray’s ongoing business operations; (iv) the risk that the merger may be completed even though certain events occur prior to the closing of the merger that materially and adversely affect Tilray or Privateer; (v) that the market price of Tilray’s common stock following the merger may decline as a result of the merger; (vi) risks related to the failure or delay in obtaining required approvals from any governmental or quasi-governmental entity necessary to consummate the proposed merger; (vii) that the merger will involve substantial costs, and that there may be certain unexpected costs, charges or expenses resulting from the transaction; (viii) potential adverse reactions or changes to business relationships resulting from the announcement or completion of the proposed merger; (ix) risks related to the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted in connection with the merger agreement; and (x) that certain provisions of the merger agreement may discourage third parties from submitting alternative takeover proposals, including proposals that may be superior to the arrangements contemplated by the merger agreement.

The forward-looking statements are expressly qualified by this cautionary statement. Any information or statements that are contained in this news release that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements in this news release with regards to: (i) statements relating to Aphria’s and Tilray’s strategic business combination and the expected terms, timing and closing of the Arrangement including, receipt of required regulatory approvals, shareholder approvals, court approvals and satisfaction of other closing customary conditions; (ii) estimates of pro-forma financial information of the Combined Company, including in respect of expected revenues and production of cannabis; (iii) estimates of future costs applicable to sales; (iv) estimates of future capital expenditures; (v) estimates of future cost reductions, synergies including pre-tax synergies, savings and efficiencies; (vi) statements that the Combined Company anticipates to have scalable medical and adult-use cannabis platforms expected to strengthen the leadership position in Canada, United States and internationally; (vii) statements that the Combined Company is expected to offer a diversified and branded product offering and distribution footprint, world-class cultivation, processing and manufacturing facilities; (viii) statements in respect of operational efficiencies expected to be generated as a result of the Arrangement in the amount of more than C$100 million of pre-tax annual cost synergies; (ix) expectations of future balance sheet strength and future equity; (x) that the Combined Company is expected to unlock significant shareholder value; and (xi) statements under the heading “Strategic and Financial Benefits” of this news release. Aphria and Tilray use words such as “forecast”, “future”, “should”, “could”, “enable”, “potential”, “contemplate”, “believe”, “anticipate”, “estimate”, “plan”, “expect”, “intend”, “may”, “project”, “will”, “would” and the negative of these terms or similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. Various assumptions were used in drawing the conclusions contained in the forward-looking statements throughout this news release. Forward-looking statements reflect current beliefs of management of Aphria and Tilray with respect to future events and are based on information currently available to each respective management including based on reasonable assumptions, estimates, internal and external analysis and opinions of management of Aphria and Tilray considering their experience, perception of trends, current conditions and expected developments as well as other factors that each respective management believes to be relevant as at the date such statements are made. Forward-looking statements involve significant known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause actual results, performance or achievement to be materially different from any future forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to, risks assumptions and expectations described in Aphria’s and Tilray’s critical accounting policies and estimates; the adoption and impact of certain accounting pronouncements; Aphria’s and Tilray’s future financial and operating performance; the competitive and business strategies of Aphria and Tilray ; the intention to grow the business, operations and potential activities of Aphria and Tilray; the ability of Aphria and Tilray to complete the Arrangement; Aphria’s and Tilray’s ability to provide a return on investment; Aphria’s and Tilray’s ability to maintain a strong financial position and manage costs, the ability of Aphria and Tilray to maximize the utilization of their existing assets and investments and that the completion of the Arrangement is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions as set forth in the Arrangement Agreement. There can be no assurance as to when these conditions will be satisfied or waived, if at all, or that other events will not intervene to delay or result in the failure to complete the Arrangement. There is a risk that some or all the expected benefits of the Arrangement may fail to materialize or may not occur within the time periods anticipated by Aphria and Tilray. The challenge of coordinating previously independent businesses makes evaluating the business and future financial prospects of the Combined Company following the Arrangement difficult. Material risks that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements also include the inherent uncertainty associated with the financial and other projections; the prompt and effective integration of the Combined Company; the ability to achieve the anticipated synergies and value-creation contemplated by the proposed transaction; the risk associated with Aphria’s and Tilray’s ability to obtain the approval of the proposed transaction by their shareholders required to consummate the proposed transaction and the timing of the closing of the proposed transaction, including the risk that the conditions to the transaction are not satisfied on a timely basis or at all; the risk that a consent or authorization that may be required for the proposed transaction is not obtained or is obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated; the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against the parties and others related to the Arrangement Agreement; unanticipated difficulties or expenditures relating to the transaction, the response of business partners and retention as a result of the announcement and pendency of the transaction; risks relating to the value of Tilray’s common stock to be issued in connection with the transaction; the impact of competitive responses to the announcement of the transaction; and the diversion of management time on transaction-related issues. For a more detailed discussion of risks and other factors, see the most recently filed annual information form of Aphria and the annual report filed on form 10-K of Tilray made with applicable securities regulatory authorities and available on SEDAR and EDGAR. The forward-looking statements included in this news release are made as of the date of this news release and neither Aphria nor Tilray undertake any obligation to publicly update such forward-looking statements to reflect new information, subsequent events or otherwise unless required by applicable securities laws. 2 Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.

(“Natura”) for total consideration of up to C$70 million. The acquisition of Natura will occur pursuant to a plan of arrangement under Section 182 of the Business Corporations Act (Ontario) (the “Arrangement”). In connection with its entrance into the Arrangement Agreement, pursuant to the terms of the Arrangement Agreement, Tilray also entered into voting support agreements with the directors and officers of Natura and certain key shareholders of Natura, pursuant to which such persons agreed to vote the securities held by them in favor of the Arrangement at the special meeting of Natura shareholders called to consider the Arrangement (the “Natura Meeting”). Pursuant to the Arrangement, and subject to certain customary adjustments, Tilray will acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Natura in consideration for (a) the issuance of C$20 million of shares of class 2 Common Stock of Tilray (“Common Stock”) to Natura shareholders (the “Share Consideration”), (b) the payment of C$15 million in cash to Natura Shareholders (the “Cash Consideration”) and (c) the issuance of promissory notes to the Natura Shareholders (the “Promissory Notes” and, together with the Share Consideration and the Cash Consideration, the “Consideration”). Natura shareholders will receive their pro rata portion of the Cash Consideration after the deduction of certain transaction expenses incurred by Natura and subject to applicable withholding taxes. The Promissory Notes will entitle the Natura Shareholders to up to an additional C$35 million of Tilray Common Stock contingent upon the achievement by Natura of certain quarterly production milestones over the 12 month period beginning on February 1, 2019. The Common Stock issuable upon the closing of the Arrangement will be issued at a price per share of Common Stock equal to the greater of (a) the 10 day volume-weighted average price (“VWAP”) of shares of the Common Stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (the “Nasdaq”) for the 10 trading day period ending on January 29, 2019 and (b) the lowest price permitted by the Nasdaq. The Common Stock issuable upon the achievement of the quarterly production milestones, if any, will be issued at a price per share of Common Stock equal to the greater of (a) the 15 day VWAP of shares of Common Stock on the Nasdaq for the 15 trading day period beginning on the trading day immediately following the end of the applicable three month period and (b) the lowest price permitted by the Nasdaq. No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued. At the effective time of the Arrangement: (i) all in-the-money common share purchase warrants of Natura (“Warrants”) will be exercised pursuant to the Arrangement for common shares of Natura, which will be exchanged for the Consideration payable to such holder as a shareholder of Natura; and (ii) all out-of-the-money Warrants will be exchanged for warrants to purchase Common Stock (“Tilray Warrants”), such Tilray Warrants being exercisable at an adjusted exercise price for an adjusted amount of Common Stock. The completion of the Arrangement is subject to customary conditions precedent, including approval by 66 2 ⁄ 3 % of the votes cast in person or by proxy at the Natura Meeting and approval by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice (Commercial List). Pursuant to the Arrangement Agreement, Tilray and Natura each gave customary representations and warranties for a transaction of the nature of the Arrangement. Unless otherwise agreed to by Natura and Tilray, the closing of the Arrangement must occur on or before February 28, 2019. In the event that the Arrangement Agreement is terminated by Natura or Tilray in certain circumstances, including in the event that Natura accepts a “superior proposal”, Natura shall be liable to pay Tilray a “break-fee” of $2,100,000. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Arrangement Agreement were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the Arrangement Agreement.

Lock-Up Release As previously announced, on December 12, 2019, Tilray, Inc. (“Tilray”) completed its transaction with Privateer Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Privateer”), in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of September 9, 2019 (the “Merger Agreement”) by and among Tilray, Privateer, Down River Merger Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of Tilray and Michael Blue, as the Stockholder Representative. Pursuant to the terms described in the Merger Agreement, Privateer merged with and into Merger Sub (the “Merger”), with Merger Sub surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Tilray. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each Privateer equity holder who received shares of Tilray common stock in the Merger is subject to a lock-up (the “Lock-Up Agreement”) allowing for the sale of such shares only under certain circumstances over a two-year period. During the first year following the closing of the Merger, the Lock-Up Agreement provides that the subject shares are permitted to be sold pursuant to certain offerings, block trades or strategic sales approved or arranged by Tilray, at the discretion of its Board of Directors. At the end of the first year, the lock-up restrictions lapse with respect to 50 percent of the total shares subject to Lock-Up Agreement (with permitted sales being credited towards and included in such 50%) will be released. Over the course of the second year following the closing of the Merger, the remaining shares will be subject to a staggered release in four equal quarterly increments. On March 25, 2020, the Board of Directors of Tilray unanimously approved the pro rata release of 11 million shares of Class 2 common stock from the Lock-Up Agreement as a permitted sale (the “Waiver and Release”), waiving the release requirements included in the Lock-Up Agreement and treating the release of such shares as permitted sales. The Waiver and Release will take effect on April 3, 2020, and the released shares may be sold on or after that date, subject to applicable securities law or contractual limitations. The Waiver and Release will apply on a pro rata basis to each former Privateer equity holder who received shares of or options to purchase Tilray Class 2 common stock in the Merger, including certain of Tilray’s officers and directors. The Waiver and Release applies to approximately 14.5% of the locked-up shares (including for purposes of such percentage calculation shares that remain subject to escrow and/or subject to outstanding assumed stock options). 1 SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

Entry into a Material Agreement. Arrangement Agreement Amendment As previously disclosed on December 15, 2020, Tilray, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Tilray”), and Aphria Inc., a corporation existing under the laws of the Province of Ontario (“Aphria”), entered into an Arrangement Agreement (the “Arrangement Agreement”), pursuant to which all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Aphria (the “Aphria Shares”) will be exchanged for Class 2 common stock of Tilray, in accordance with a specified exchange ratio, pursuant to a plan of arrangement (the “Plan of Arrangement”) under the Business Corporations Act (Ontario) (the “Arrangement”). On February 19, 2021, Tilray and Aphria entered into an amendment to the Arrangement Agreement and Plan of Arrangement (the “Amendment”). The Amendment, among other things: (i) provides that Aphria will convene and conduct the Aphria Meeting in connection with the Arrangement, as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event not later than June 30, 2021); (ii) provides that Tilray will convene and conduct the Tilray Meeting in connection with the Arrangement, as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event not later than June 30, 2021); (iii) provides that certain holders of Aphria’s outstanding restricted share units or deferred share units and certain holders of options to acquire Aphria Shares will not exchange such securities for replacement securities issued by Tilray pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement but will continue to hold such securities in accordance with the applicable terms of the Aphria Benefit Plans (as defined in the Arrangement Agreement). Pursuant to the provisions of the Aphria Benefit Plans, such securities will be settled or exercisable, as applicable, for Tilray Shares in accordance with their terms following the completion of the Arrangement; (iv) clarifies the requisite approval of Tilray stockholders required to complete the Arrangement, in accordance with the Arrangement Agreement and (v) makes certain corresponding edits to the Arrangement Agreement to implement the foregoing.

Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements Certain information in this communication constitutes forward-looking information or forward-looking statements (together, “forward-looking statements”) under Canadian securities laws and within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created by such sections and other applicable laws. The forward-looking statements are expressly qualified by this cautionary statement. Any information or statements that are contained in this communication that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements in this communication with regards to: (i) statements relating to Aphria’s and Tilray’s strategic business combination and the expected terms, timing and closing of the Arrangement including, receipt of required regulatory approvals, shareholder approvals, court approvals and satisfaction of other closing customary conditions; (ii) estimates of pro-forma financial information of the combined company, including in respect of expected revenues and production of cannabis; (iii) estimates of future costs applicable to sales; (iv) estimates of future capital expenditures; (v) estimates of future cost reductions, synergies including pre-tax synergies, savings and efficiencies; (vi) statements that the combined company anticipates to have scalable medical and adult-use cannabis platforms expected to strengthen the leadership position in Canada, United States and internationally; (vii) statements that the combined company is expected to offer a diversified and branded product offering and distribution footprint, world-class cultivation, processing and manufacturing facilities; (viii) statements in respect of operational efficiencies expected to be generated as a result of the Arrangement in the amount of more than C$100 million of pre-tax annual cost synergies; (ix) expectations of future balance sheet strength and future equity; (x) that the combined company is expected to unlock significant shareholder value; and (xi) statements under the heading “Strategic and Financial Benefits” of this communication. Aphria and Tilray use words such as “forecast”, “future”, “should”, “could”, “enable”, “potential”, “contemplate”, “believe”, “anticipate”, “estimate”, “plan”, “expect”, “intend”, “may”, “project”, “will”, “would” and the negative of these terms or similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. Various assumptions were used in drawing the conclusions contained in the forward-looking statements throughout this communication. Forward-looking statements reflect current beliefs of management of Aphria and Tilray with respect to future events and are based on information currently available to each respective management including based on reasonable assumptions, estimates, internal and external analysis and opinions of management of Aphria and Tilray considering their experience, perception of trends, current conditions and expected developments as well as other factors that each respective management believes to be relevant as at the date such statements are made. Forward-looking statements involve significant known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause actual results, performance or achievement to be materially different from any future forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to, risks assumptions and expectations described in Aphria’s and Tilray’s critical accounting policies and estimates; the adoption and impact of certain accounting pronouncements; Aphria’s and Tilray’s future financial and operating performance; the competitive and business strategies of Aphria and Tilray ; the intention to grow the business, operations and potential activities of Aphria and Tilray; the ability of Aphria and Tilray to complete the Arrangement; Aphria’s and Tilray’s ability to provide a return on investment; Aphria’s and Tilray’s ability to maintain a strong financial position and manage costs, the ability of Aphria and Tilray to maximize the utilization of their existing assets and investments and that the completion of the Arrangement is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions as set forth in the Arrangement Agreement. There can be no assurance as to when these conditions will be satisfied or waived, if at all, or that other events will not intervene to delay or result in the failure to complete the Arrangement. There is a risk that some or all the expected benefits of the Arrangement may fail to materialize or may not occur within the time periods anticipated by Aphria and Tilray. The challenge of coordinating previously independent businesses makes evaluating the business and future financial prospects of the combined company following the Arrangement difficult. Material risks that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements also include the inherent uncertainty associated with the financial and other projections; the prompt and effective integration of the combined company; the ability to achieve the anticipated synergies and value-creation contemplated by the proposed transaction; the risk associated with Aphria’s and Tilray’s ability to obtain the approval of the proposed transaction by their shareholders required to consummate the proposed transaction and the timing of the closing of the proposed transaction, including the risk that the conditions to the transaction are not satisfied on a timely basis or at all; the risk that a consent or authorization that may be required for the proposed transaction is not obtained or is obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated; the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against the parties and others related to the Arrangement Agreement; unanticipated difficulties or expenditures relating to the transaction, the response of business partners and retention as a result of the announcement and pendency of the transaction; risks relating to the value of Tilray’s common stock to be issued in connection with the transaction; the impact of competitive responses to the announcement of the transaction; and the diversion of management time on transaction-related issues. For a more detailed discussion of risks and other factors, see the most recently filed annual information form of Aphria and the annual report filed on form 10-K of Tilray made with applicable securities regulatory authorities and available on SEDAR and EDGAR. The forward-looking statements included in this communication are made as of the date of this communication and neither Aphria nor Tilray undertake any obligation to publicly update such forward-looking statements to reflect new information, subsequent events or otherwise unless required by applicable securities laws.

On February 19, 2019, Tilray, Inc. (“Tilray”) entered into a definitive agreement (the “Arrangement Agreement”) to acquire, through a wholly owned subsidiary (“Tilray Subco”), all of the issued and outstanding securities of FHF Holdings Ltd. (“FHF”) for total consideration of up to C$419 million. The acquisition of FHF will occur pursuant to a plan of arrangement under Division 5 of Part 9 of the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) (the “Arrangement”). Pursuant to the Arrangement, and subject to certain customary adjustments, Tilray will acquire all of the issued and outstanding securities of FHF in consideration for (a) the payment of C$150 million in cash to the holders of preferred shares of FHF and the holders of common shares of FHF (“Common Holders”) and the issuance of C$127.5 million of shares of class 2 Common Stock of Tilray (“Common Stock”) to the Common Holders on the closing date of the Arrangement (the “Closing Date Consideration”), (b) the payment of C$50 million in cash and the issuance of C$42.5 million in Common Stock to the Common Holders on the date that is six months after the closing date of the Arrangement (the “Deferred Consideration”) and (c) the issuance of up to C$49 million of Common Stock to the Common Holders, which amount will be reduced if FHF fails to attain certain levels of U.S. branded gross sales of edible or topical products containing broad spectrum hemp extracts or cannabidiols by FHF prior to December 31, 2019 (the “Milestone Consideration” and, together with the Closing Date Consideration and the Deferred Consideration, the “Consideration”). The cash portion of the Closing Date Consideration will be reduced by the amount of the net indebtedness of FHF on the closing date and a transaction expense amount of $5,000,000. If Tilray is restricted, delayed or prohibited from issuing any Common Stock in connection with the Arrangement, or if the Issue Price (as discussed below) of the Common Stock is less than $56.37, any amount of the Consideration payable in Common Stock may be paid in an equivalent amount of cash. The issue price of the Common Stock payable in connection with Arrangement (the “Issue Price”) will be, at the relevant date, the greater of (i) the 15 day volume-weighted average price of the Common Stock on the Nasdaq for the 15 consecutive trading day period ending on the trading day immediately prior to such determination date and (ii) the lowest price permitted by the Nasdaq, in either case converted into Canadian dollars at the daily average exchange rate published by the Bank of Canada for the last day of such 15 consecutive day period. The relevant date for (i) the Common Stock issuable as Closing Date Consideration is the closing date of the Arrangement, (ii) the Common Stock issuable as Deferred Consideration is the date that is six months after the closing date of the Arrangement and (iii) the Milestone Consideration is the date the Milestone Consideration is finally determined. At the effective time of the Arrangement: (i) all performance-based stock options of FHF will be cancelled; (ii) all in-the-money stock options of FHF remaining after such cancellation will fully vest and will be transferred to FHF in exchange for the issuance by FHF of an amount of common shares of FHF equal to the number of common shares of FHF subject to such stock options less the number of common shares of FHF (valued at C$131.96 per common share) equal to the aggregate exercise price of such options, which common shares of FHF will be exchanged pursuant to the Arrangement for the Consideration payable to the holder thereof as a shareholder of FHF; and (iii) all remaining stock options of FHF will be cancelled.

On April 11, 2022, Tilray Brands, Inc. (the “ Company ” or “ Tilray ”) entered into an assignment and assumption agreement (the “ Assignment Agreement ”) to acquire from HT Investments MA LLC (“ HTI ”) all of the outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest under a secured convertible note (as amended and restated, the “ Note ”) issued by HEXO Corp. (“ HEXO ”). The purchase price for the Note will be an amount equal to 95% of the outstanding principal balance as of the closing (approximately $193 million as of the date hereof, and such amount at closing to be not less than $160 million) plus the accrued and unpaid interest on the Note. The purchase price shall be payable, at Tilray’s option (subject to certain conditions and limitations), in cash consideration, Class 2 Common Stock of Tilray or any combination thereof. To the extent that the Note is acquired with Class 2 Common Stock of Tilray, the Assignment Agreement provides for a post-closing adjustment, such that if the purchase price (less any amounts satisfied or to be satisfied in cash) divided by the daily volume weighted average price (the “ VWAP Price ”) of the Class 2 Common Stock of Tilray for the 44-trading day period following closing (i) is less than the number of shares issued at closing, then HTI shall deliver to Tilray a cash amount equal to such difference multiplied by the VWAP Price, and (ii) is greater than the number of shares issued at closing, then Tilray shall deliver to HTI in cash or additional shares, at Tilray’s option (subject to certain conditions and limitations), an amount equal to such difference multiplied by the VWAP Price. The issuance of the maximum number of shares of Class 2 Common Stock of Tilray that may be issued to HTI under the Assignment Agreement was registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission under the Company’s Registration Statement on Form S-3 (333-233703). Immediately prior to the closing of the Transaction, the Note will be amended and restated to reflect, among other things, a maturity date of May 1, 2026 and an initial conversion price of CAN$0.85. The Note will provide Tilray with HEXO board governance rights to appoint one director and one board observer. HEXO also agreed to provide Tilray with customary registration rights in respect of the common shares of HEXO into which the Note is convertible. In addition, under the terms of the Note, Tilray will receive “top-up” and preemptive rights enabling it to maintain its percentage ownership (on an “as-converted” basis) in the event that Hexo issues equity or debt securities following acquisition of the Note by Tilray. In connection with the Assignment Agreement, each of Tilray, HEXO and HTI entered into a Transaction Agreement, dated as of April 11, 2022 (the “ Transaction Agreement ”), setting forth the terms and conditions for the Note amendment and additional covenants and representations of the parties. The Transaction Agreement also provides for Tilray and HEXO to enter into commercial transaction agreements to achieve production efficiencies and cost-saving synergies, including an $18 million annual advisory fee payable to Tilray. Each of the transactions and agreements described above are subject to several closing conditions, including receipt of HEXO shareholder approval; applicable regulatory approvals; and Tilray and HEXO having entered into commercial arrangements to achieve production efficiencies and cost-saving synergies.

Emerging growth company ☐ If an emerging growth company, indicate by check mark if the registrant has elected not to use the extended transition period for complying with any new or revised financial accounting standards provided pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act. ☐ Introductory Note. As previously disclosed in the Current Reports on Forms 8-K and 8-K/A filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “ SEC ”) on May 4, 2021, by Tilray, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“ Tilray ”), Tilray consummated a plan of arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (Ontario) (the “ Arrangement ”) with Aphria Inc., a corporation existing under the laws of the Province of Ontario (“ Aphria ”), on April 30, 2021. For accounting purposes, the Arrangement was treated as a reverse acquisition, and Aphria was considered the accounting acquirer. Accordingly, following the consummation of the Arrangement, the historical financial statements of Aphria became the historical financial statements of Tilray. Prior to the completion of the Arrangement, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“ PwC ”) served as the independent registered public accounting firm of Aphria, and Deloitte LLP (“ Deloitte ”) served as the independent registered public accounting firm of Tilray. Item 4.01. Changes in Registrant’s Certifying Accountant. (a) Dismissal of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm On May 21, 2021, the board of directors of Tilray (the “ Board ”) approved the dismissal of Deloitte as Tilray’s independent registered public accounting firm, and on the same day, Tilray dismissed Deloitte as its independent registered public accounting firm. Deloitte’s audit report on Tilray’s consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, and was not qualified or modified as to uncertainties, audit scope or accounting principles. During the interim period from January 1, 2021 through May 21, 2021, and the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were no disagreements between Tilray and Deloitte on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Deloitte would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in its report on Tilray’s financial statements for such periods. During the interim period from January 1, 2021 through May 21, 2021, and the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were no “reportable events” (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act on 1934, as amended), except as noted below. Fiscal 2020 As disclosed in Item 9A of Tilray’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on February 19, 2021 (as amended on April 28, 2021), Deloitte expressed an adverse opinion on Tilray’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, due to material weaknesses relating to: (i) ineffective controls over the review procedures for balance sheet account reconciliations and manual journal entries; (ii) ineffective controls over the completeness and accuracy of key spreadsheets and reports used in the measurement and valuation of inventory; and (iii) lack of evidence of review procedures and lack of sufficient segregation of duties within the accounting function for the Portugal and Manitoba Harvest business units. Fiscal 2019 As disclosed in Item 9A of Tilray’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on March 2, 2020 (as amended on April 29, 2020), Deloitte expressed an adverse opinion on Tilray’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, due to material weaknesses relating to (i) appropriate organizational structure, reporting lines, and authority and responsibilities in pursuit of objectives; (ii) Tilray’s commitment to attract, develop, and retain competent individuals; (iii) holding individuals accountable for their internal control related responsibilities; (iv) selecting and developing control activities that contribute to the mitigation of risks to the achievement of objectives to acceptable levels; and (v) deploying control activities through policies that establish what is expected and procedures that put policies into action. The subject matter of these reportable events was discussed by the audit committee of the Board (the “ Audit Committee ”) with Deloitte. Tilray has authorized Deloitte to respond fully to the inquiries of Tilray’s newly appointed independent registered public accounting firm concerning the subject matter of the reportable events described above. Tilray provided Deloitte with a copy of the foregoing disclosures and requested that Deloitte furnish Tilray with a letter addressed to the SEC stating whether it agrees with the statements made by Tilray set forth above. A copy of Deloitte’s letter dated May 21, 2021, is filed as Exhibit 16.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. (b) Appointment of New Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm On May 21, 2021, the Board, acting upon recommendation of the Audit Committee, approved the engagement of PwC, effective as of May 21, 2021, as Tilray’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 to audit Tilray’s financial statements. During the interim period from June 1, 2020 through May 21, 2021, and the fiscal years ended May 31, 2020 and 2019, neither Tilray nor anyone on its behalf consulted with PwC, regarding either: (i) the application of accounting principles to a specific transaction, completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on Tilray’s financial statements, and neither a written report nor oral advice was provided to Tilray that PwC concluded was an important factor considered by Tilray in reaching a decision as to any accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions) or a reportable event (as described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K).

Other Events. As previously disclosed on December 15, 2020, Tilray, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Tilray”), and Aphria Inc., a corporation existing under the laws of the Province of Ontario (“Aphria”), entered into an Arrangement Agreement, as amended on February 19, 2021, (the “Arrangement Agreement”), pursuant to which all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Aphria will be exchanged for Class 2 common stock of Tilray, in accordance with a specified exchange ratio, pursuant to a plan of arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (Ontario) (the “Arrangement”). On March 12, 2020, Tilray filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) a definitive joint proxy statement/circular (the “Proxy Statement/Circular”) with respect to the special meeting of Tilray stockholders scheduled to be held on April 16, 2021 pursuant to the Arrangement. Litigation Related to the Merger In connection with the Arrangement, after the Proxy Statement/Circular was filed, three stockholder lawsuits have been filed: (i) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Violini v. Tilray, Inc. et al. , Case No. 1:21-cv-02256 (the “Violini Complaint”); (ii) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Barron-Archer v. Tilray, Inc. et al. , Case No. 1:21-cv-02497 (the “Barron-Archer Complaint”); and (ii) in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, captioned Reveles v. Tilray, Inc. et al. , Case No. 1:21-cv-01543 (the “Reveles Complaint”), and together with the Violini Complaint and the Barron-Archer Complaint, the “Complaints”) The Complaints generally allege, among other things, that Tilray and the members of its Board of Directors omitted purportedly material information from the Proxy Statement/Circular. The Barron-Archer Complaint includes the additional claim that the members of the Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duties with respect to the alleged omissions. The Complaints seek, among other things, additional disclosure of facts relating to the Arrangement and/or injunctive relief. Additional similar lawsuits may be filed in the future. Tilray believes that the plaintiffs’ allegations in the Complaints lack merit. If additional similar complaints are filed, or if the Complaints are amended, absent new or different allegations that are material, Tilray will not necessarily disclose such additional filings or subsequent amendments. The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Complaints which are attached hereto as Exhibits 99.1, 99.2, and 99.3 are incorporated by reference herein. Additional Information and Where to Find It In connection with the proposed business combination (the “Transaction”), Tilray has filed a Proxy Statement/Circular containing important information about the Transaction and related matters. The Proxy Statement/Circular has also been made available by Aphria and Tilray on their respective SEDAR profiles. Additionally, Aphria and Tilray will file other relevant materials in connection with the Transaction with the applicable securities regulatory authorities. Investors and security holders of Aphria and Tilray are urged to carefully read the entire Proxy Statement/Circular (including any amendments or supplements to such documents), respectively, before making any voting decision with respect to the Transaction because they contain important information about the Transaction and the parties to the Transaction. The Proxy Statement/Circular will be mailed to the Aphria Shareholders and Tilray Stockholders and is accessible on the SEDAR and EDGAR profiles of the respective companies. Investors and security holders of Tilray can obtain a free copy of the Proxy Statement/Circular, as well as other relevant filings containing information about Tilray and the Transaction, including materials incorporated by reference into the Proxy Statement/Circular, without charge, at the SEC’s website ( www.sec.gov ) or from Tilray by contacting Tilray’s Investor Relations at (203) 682-8253, by email at Raphael.Gross@icrinc.com , or by going to Tilray’s Investor Relations page on its website at https://ir.tilray.com/investor-relations and clicking on the link titled “Financials.” Investors and security holders of Aphria are able to obtain a free copy of the Proxy Statement/Circular, as well as other relevant filings containing information about Aphria and the Transaction, including materials incorporated by reference into the Proxy Statement/Circular, without charge, under Aphria’s profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com or from Aphria by contacting Aphria’s investor relations at investors@aphria.com .

Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements Certain information in this email constitutes forward-looking information or forward-looking statements (together, “forward-looking statements”) under Canadian securities laws and within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created by such sections and other applicable laws. The forward-looking statements are expressly qualified by this cautionary statement. Forward-looking statements are provided for the purpose of presenting information about management’s current expectations and plans relating to the future, and readers are cautioned that such statements may not be appropriate for other purposes. Any information or statements that are contained in this email that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements in this email with regards to: (i) statements relating to the strategic business combination of Aphria and Tilray and the expected timing and closing of the Transaction; Transaction including, receipt of required shareholder approvals, court approvals and satisfaction of other closing customary conditions; (ii) estimates of pro-forma financial information of the Combined Company, including in respect of expected revenues and production of cannabis; (iii) the expected strategic and financial benefits of the business combination, including estimates of future cost reductions, synergies, including expected pre-tax synergies, savings and efficiencies; (iv) statements that the Combined Company anticipates having scalable medical and adult-use cannabis platforms expected to strengthen the leadership position in Canada, internationally and, eventually in the United States; (v) statements that the Combined Company is expected to offer a diversified and branded product offering and distribution footprint, state-of-the-art cultivation, processing and manufacturing facilities; (vi) statements in respect of operational efficiencies expected to be generated as a result of the Transaction in the amount of approximately C$100 million of pre-tax annual cost synergies; (vii) statements regarding the value and returns to shareholders expected to be generated by the business combination; (viii) expectations of future balance sheet strength and future equity; (ix) expectations regarding the Combined Company’s future M&A strategy; and (x) the expectation that the Combined Company’s shares will be listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange concurrently with, or as soon as possible after, the closing of the Transaction. Aphria and Tilray use words such as “forecast”, “future”, “should”, “could”, “enable”, “potential”, “contemplate”, “believe”, “anticipate”, “estimate”, “plan”, “expect”, “intend”, “may”, “project”, “will”, “would” and the negative of these terms or similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. Certain material factors or assumptions were used in drawing the conclusions contained in the forward-looking statements throughout this email, including the ability of the parties to receive, in a timely manner and on satisfactory terms, the necessary shareholder and court approvals for the Transaction, the ability of the parties to satisfy, in a timely manner, the conditions to closing of the Transaction and other expectations and assumptions concerning the Transaction. Forward-looking statements reflect current beliefs of management of Aphria and Tilray with respect to future events and are based on information currently available to each respective management team including the reasonable assumptions, estimates, analysis and opinions of management of Aphria and Tilray considering their experience, perception of trends, current conditions and expected developments as well as other factors that each respective management believes to be relevant as at the date such statements are made. Forward-looking statements involve significant known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause actual results, performance or achievement to be materially different from any future forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to, risks assumptions and expectations described in Aphria’s and Tilray’s critical accounting policies and estimates; the adoption and impact of certain accounting pronouncements; Aphria’s and Tilray’s future financial and operating performance; the competitive and business strategies of Aphria and Tilray; the intention to grow the business, operations and potential activities of Aphria and Tilray; the ability of Aphria and Tilray to complete the Transaction; Aphria’s and Tilray’s ability to provide a return on investment; Aphria’s and Tilray’s ability to maintain a strong financial position and manage costs, the ability of Aphria and Tilray to maximize the utilization of their existing assets and investments and that the completion of the Transaction is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions as set forth in the Arrangement Agreement. There can be no assurance as to when these conditions will be satisfied or waived, if at all, or that other events will not intervene to delay or result in the failure to complete the Transaction. There is a risk that some or all the expected benefits of the Transaction may fail to materialize or may not occur within the time periods anticipated by Aphria and Tilray. The challenge of coordinating previously independent businesses makes evaluating the business and future financial prospects of the Combined Company following the Transaction difficult. Material risks that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements also include the inherent uncertainty associated with the financial and other projections a well as market changes arising from governmental actions or market conditions in response to the COVID-19 public health crisis; the prompt and effective integration of the Combined Company; the ability to achieve the anticipated synergies and value-creation contemplated by the Transaction; the risk associated with Aphria’s and Tilray’s ability to obtain the approval of the proposed transaction by their shareholders required to consummate the Transaction and the timing of the closing of the Transaction, including the risk that the conditions to the Transaction are not satisfied on a timely basis or at all; the risk that a consent or authorization that may be required for the Transaction is not obtained or is obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated; the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against the parties and others related to the Arrangement Agreement; unanticipated difficulties or expenditures relating to the Transaction, the response of business partners and retention as a result of the announcement and pendency of the Transaction; risks relating to the value of Tilray’s common stock to be issued in connection with the transaction; the impact of competitive responses to the announcement of the Transaction; and the diversion of management time on transaction-related issues. Readers are cautioned that the foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive. Other risks and uncertainties not presently known to Aphria and Tilray or that Aphria and Tilray presently believe are not material could also cause actual results or events to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements contained herein. For a more detailed discussion of risks and other factors, see the most recently filed annual information form of Aphria and the annual report filed on form 10-K of Tilray made with applicable securities regulatory authorities and available on SEDAR and EDGAR. The forward-looking statements included in this email are made as of the date of this email and neither Aphria nor Tilray undertake any obligation to publicly update such forward-looking statements to reflect new information, subsequent events or otherwise unless required by applicable securities laws.

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement Assignment and Assumption Agreement On February 21, 2023, Tilray Brands, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“ Tilray ” or the “ Company ”), entered into an assignment and assumption agreement (the “ Assignment and Assumption Agreement ”) with Double Diamond Holdings Ltd. (“ DDH ”), an Ontario corporation, pursuant to which, among other things, Tilray acquired from DDH a promissory note in the amount of USD$6,648,304 (the “ Note ”) payable by 1974568 Ontario Limited (“ Aphria Diamond ”). DDH is a joint venturer with Aphria Inc., Tilray’s direct and wholly-owned subsidiary, in Aphria Diamond. As consideration for the Note, Tilray issued 2,208,739 shares of its Class 2 common stock and 120,000 shares of its Series A preferred stock (collectively, the “ Consideration Shares ”) to DDH. Voting Agreement Also on February 21, 2023, in connection with the execution of the Assignment and Assumption Agreement, DDH entered into a voting agreement (the “ Voting Agreement ”) with the Company. After giving effect to the transactions contemplated by the Assignment and Assumption Agreement, DDH beneficially owns less than 1% percent of the outstanding shares of Class 2 common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (the “ Class 2 Common Stock ”), taking into account shares of Series A preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (the “ Preferred Stock ” or “ Series A Preferred Stock ”) on an as-if-converted-to-Class-2-Common-Stock basis. Under the Voting Agreement, DDH has (a) agreed to vote the Consideration Shares, and any other shares of capital stock of the Company it acquires following the execution of the Voting Agreement, (i) in favor of the Charter Amendments (as defined below) at any meeting of the Company’s stockholders held to vote thereon (including at any adjournment and postponement thereof); and (ii) against any action, proposal, transaction, or agreement that could reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, delay, discourage, adversely affect, or inhibit the timely approval of the Charter Amendments or the holding of any meeting to vote thereon (including any adjournment or postponement thereof) or change in any manner the voting rights of any class of shares of the Company (including any amendments to the Company’s organizational documents which are not otherwise consistent with the Charter Amendments); and (b) granted to the Company an irrevocable proxy to vote such shares in such manner. The Voting Agreement also contains restrictions on the transfer of any shares of Preferred Stock of the Company held by DDH during the term of the Voting Agreement. The foregoing description of the Voting Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Voting Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated by reference herein. Item 3.02. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities. The information set forth in Item 1.01 of this Form 8-K is incorporated into this Item 3.02 by reference. The Consideration Shares were issued in reliance on the exemption provided by Regulation S (“ Regulation S ”) of the Securities Act which permits offers or sales of securities by the Company outside of the United States that are not made to “U.S. Persons” or for the account or benefit of a “U.S. Person,” as that term is defined in Rule 902 of Regulation S. No underwriter participated in the offer and sale of the Consideration Shares, and no commission or other remuneration was paid or given directly or indirectly in connection therewith. Item 3.03. Material Modifications to Rights of Security Holders. To the extent required, the information included below in Item 5.03 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is hereby incorporated by reference into this Item 3.03. Item. 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year. On February 21, 2023, in connection with the issuance of the Consideration Shares, Tilray filed a certificate of designation (the “ Certificate of Designation ”) with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, effective as of the time of filing, designating the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock. General; No Transferability . Shares of Series A Preferred Stock will be uncertificated and represented in book-entry form. No shares of Series A Preferred Stock may be transferred by the holder thereof. Voting Rights . The Certificate of Designation provides that each share of Preferred Stock will have 1,000 votes and will vote together with the outstanding shares of Class 2 Common Stock as a single class exclusively with respect to any proposal to adopt amendments to the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation (as amended) (collectively, the “ Charter Amendments ”) (as the same may be set forth and more particularly described in any definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission) by (a) eliminating provisions relating to the Company’s Class 1 common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “ Class 1 Common Stock ”), in connection with the previous automatic conversion of all issued and outstanding shares of Class 1 Common Stock into shares of Class 2 Common Stock, (b) reclassifying the authorized shares of Class 1 Common Stock as Class 2 Common Stock, and (c) adding a provision to automatically reclassify each issued and outstanding share of Class 2 Common Stock as one share of common stock, par value $0.0001, of the Company (“ Common Stock ”), the cumulative result being the Company having only two classes of stock authorized for issuance—Common Stock and Preferred Stock. The Series A Preferred Stock will be voted, without action by the holder, on any such proposal in the same proportion as shares of Class 2 Common Stock are voted. The Series A Preferred Stock otherwise has no voting rights except as otherwise required by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. Dividends . Holders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive dividends on shares of Series A Preferred Stock equal (on an as-if-converted-to-Class-2-Common-Stock basis, disregarding for such purpose any conversion limitations hereunder) to and in the same form as dividends actually paid on shares of the Class 2 Common Stock when, as and if such dividends are paid on shares of the Class 2 Common Stock. No other dividends shall be paid on shares of Series A Preferred Stock. Rank; Liquidation . The Series A Preferred Stock ranks pari passu with the Class 2 Common Stock as to any distribution of assets upon a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, whether voluntarily or involuntarily. Automatic Conversion . Upon the closing of the polls at any meeting of the Company’s stockholders held for the purpose of voting on the Charter Amendments (taking into account any adjournment or postponement thereof), each issued and outstanding share of Series A Preferred Stock will, without any further action on the part of the holder thereof or the Company, automatically be converted (the “ Automatic Conversion ”) into a number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as determined by dividing the Stated Value (as defined by the Certificate of Designation) by the Conversion Price then in effect. The conversion price per share upon an Automatic Conversion for the Series A Preferred Stock shall be the Stated Value of such share, subject to adjustment in the event that the Conversion Price then in effect is equal to or less than the Minimum Price, as defined in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(d)(1)(A) (the “ Conversion Price ”). The foregoing summary of the Certificate of Designation does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, such document, which is filed as Exhibit 3.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.

Emerging growth company ☐ If an emerging growth company, indicate by check mark if the registrant has elected not to use the extended transition period for complying with any new or revised financial accounting standards provided pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act. ☐ Introductory Note As previously disclosed in the Current Reports on Form 8-K filed by Tilray Brands, Inc. (the “ Company ” or “ Tilray ”) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “ SEC ”) on April 12, 2022 (the “ Prior April Report ”), and on June 14, 2022 (together with the Prior April Report, the “ Prior Reports ”), the Company entered into an assignment and assumption agreement on April 11, 2022, which was amended and restated on June 14, 2022 (as so amended and restated, the “ Assignment Agreement ”), pursuant to which, among other things, Tilray agreed to acquire from HT Investments MA LLC (“ HTI ”) all of the outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest under a secured convertible note (as amended and restated pursuant to the terms thereof, the “ HEXO Note ”) issued by HEXO Corp. (“ HEXO ”). In addition, a s previously disclosed in the Prior Reports, in connection with the Assignment Agreement, on April 11, 2022, each of Tilray, HEXO and HTI entered into a transaction agreement, as amended on June 14, 2022 (as so amended, the “ Transaction Agreement ”), setting forth the terms and conditions for the amendment and restatement of the HEXO Note and certain other covenants and representations of the parties. The transactions contemplated by the Assignment Agreement and the Transaction Agreement (collectively, the “ Transaction ”) were completed on July 12, 2022 (the “ Closing Date ”). Pursuant to the terms of the Assignment Agreement, Tilray acquired the HEXO Note for a total purchase price equa l to $154,940,400, representing the outstanding principal balance under the HEXO Note as of the Closing Date (after giving effect to various optional redemption payments and a partial conversion elected by HTI under the terms of the HEXO Note that occurred since the original issuance thereof), less a purchase price discount equal to 10.8% of such outstanding principal balance. The purchase price was satisfied by Tilray to HTI in the form of a newly-issued $50 million convertible promissory note (the “ Tilray Convertible Note ”) and the balance in 33,314,412 shares of Tilray’s Class 2 common stock, par value $0.0001 (the “ Common Stock ”). The portion of the purchase price that was paid in shares of Common Stock (the “ Consideration Shares ”) is subject to a post-closing adjustment, such that if the purchase price (less any amounts satisfied or to be satisfied by the Tilray Convertible Note) divided by the daily volume weighted average price (the “ VWAP ”) of Common Stock for the 44-trading day period following the Closing Date is greater than the number of Consideration Shares issued to HTI at the closing, then Tilray is required to pay to HTI, in cash or additional shares, at Tilray’s option (subject to certain conditions and limitations), an amount equal to such difference multiplied by the VWAP. The direct offering and sale to HTI of (a) the Tilray Convertible Note and (b) the aggregate number shares of Common Stock issuable (i) upon conversion or repayment of the Tilray Convertible Note and (ii) as Consideration Shares pursuant to the terms of the Assignment Agreement was registered pursuant to the Company’s registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-233703), including the prospectus contained therein, as well as a prospectus supplement filed by Tilray with the SEC in connection with the offering. Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement Tilray Convertible Note Pursuant to the terms of the Assignment Agreement, on the Closing Date, as consideration for the HEXO Note, Tilray issued to HTI the Tilray Convertible Note. The Tilray Convertible Note accrues interest on the unpaid principal balance at a rate of 4.0% per annum, matures on September 1, 2023, unless earlier converted or repurchased, and is convertible into shares of Common Stock at the option of the holder thereof in accordance with the terms set forth and more particularly described below. Interest is payable quarterly in cash or, if unpaid and accrued upon conversion or maturity, in cash or shares of Common Stock, at the Company’s option. The Tilray Convertible Note is a general unsecured obligation of the Company and: ● ranks equally in right of payment with all of Tilray’s future unsecured indebtedness; ● is senior in right of payment to any of Tilray’s future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the Tilray Convertible Note; ● is effectively junior in right of payment to any of Tilray’s secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and ● is structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of Tilray’s current or future subsidiaries. The holder of the Tilray Convertible Note may convert the note, in whole or in part, at any time prior to 5:00 p.m. on the second trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, into shares of Common Stock at a conversion price equal to 125% of the closing sale price as of the Closing Date, as adjusted in accordance with the terms of the Tilray Convertible Note, in amount not to exceed 20,000,000 shares of Common Stock in the aggregate (the “ Conversion Cap ”). In no event will the holder of the Tilray Convertible Note be allowed to effect a conversion of the note if such conversion, along with all other shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the holder and its affiliates, would exceed 9.99% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (the “ Beneficial Ownership Limitation ,” and together with the Conversion Cap, the “ Share Issuance Limitations ”). In the event that the Company is prohibited from issuing any shares of Common Stock under the Tilray Convertible Note as a result of the Conversion Cap, the Company will pay cash in lieu of any shares that would otherwise be deliverable in excess of the Conversion Cap. The conversion price or rate of the Tilray Convertible Note is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events, as specified in Section 9(d) of the Tilray Convertible Note, including: ● the issuance of shares of Common Stock as a dividend on the Common Stock; ● in the event of any stock split, reverse stock split, recapitalization, reorganization or similar transaction; and ● the distribution or dividend to all holders of Common Stock of (i) shares of Tilray capital stock, other than Common Stock, (ii) cash dividends or distributions paid from the Company’s retained earnings or (iii) subscription rights or warrants entitling such holders for a period not exceeding 60 days to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the arithmetic average trading price of the Common Stock for the 10 consecutive trading day period ending on and including the trading day immediately preceding the announcement of such distribution. The Company is not permitted to redeem or repay the Tilray Convertible Note prior to the maturity date without the prior written consent of the holder. At maturity, subject to the satisfaction of certain equity conditions (described below and more particularly in the Tilray Convertible Note), the Company may redeem the Tilray Convertible Note in whole or in part (i) in cash or (ii) in shares of Common Stock at a redemption price per share equal the daily VWAP of the Common Stock on the trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. The Company is required to deliver to the holder of the Tilray Convertible Note a notice on the 60th calendar day prior to the maturity date setting forth whether the Company will pay all or any portion of the redemption amount in cash or shares of Common Stock, and what portion, if any, of such redemption amount will be paid in shares of Common Stock and what portion will be paid in cash. The Company’s right to make payment in shares of Common Stock is dependent upon its satisfaction of certain customary equity conditions. Among other things, these equity conditions include Tilray’s continued listing on The Nasdaq Global Market or another permitted exchange and Tilray stock maintaining certain minimum average prices and trading volumes during the applicable measurement period. In addition to the payment of the redemption amount at maturity, the Company obligated to make an additional payment with respect to the Tilray Convertible Note (the “ Maturity Top-Up Payment ”), if, after 20 trading days following the maturity date (the “Maturity Top-Up Date ”), the number of shares (the “ Maturity Top-Up Measurement Amount ”) equal to (a) the quotient of (i) the redemption amount (less any amounts satisfied in cash) divided by (ii) the per-share price (the “ Maturity Top-Up Price ”) equal to the arithmetic average of the VWAP of the Common Stock for the 20 consecutive trading day period ending on and including the trading day immediately preceding such Maturity Top-Up Date is greater than (b) the number of shares of Common Stock issued as repayment for the outstanding obligations under the Tilray Convertible Note at the maturity date (the “ Maturity Shares ,” and the difference between (A) the Maturity Top-Up Measurement Amount and (B) the Maturity Shares being the “ Maturity Top-Up Difference ”). The Maturity Top-Up Payment is payable in cash or, at the Company’s option, subject to the satisfaction of certain equity conditions and subject to the Share Issuance Limitations, in shares of Common Stock. The Company is required to deliver to the holder of the Tilray Convertible Note a notice after the close of business on the trading day immediately prior to the Maturity Top-Up Date setting forth whether the Company will pay all or any portion of the applicable Maturity Top-Up Payment in cash or shares of Common Stock, and what portion, if any, of such Maturity Top-Up Payment will be paid in shares of Common Stock and what portion will be paid in cash. If the Company elects to pay all or any portion of the Maturity Top-Up Payment in cash, on the applicable Maturity Top-Up Date, the Company must pay to the holder of the Tilray Convertible Note an amount equal to the product of (i) the Maturity Top-Up Difference and (ii) the Maturity Top-Up Price. If the Company elects to pay all or any portion of the Maturity Top-Up Payment in shares of Common Stock, on the applicable Maturity Top-Up Date, the Company must deliver to the holder of the Tilray Convertible Note a number of shares of Common Stock (the “ Maturity Top-Up Shares ”) equal to the Maturity Top-Up Difference, subject to the Share Issuance Limitations. The Tilray Convertible Note contains standard and customary events of default including but not limited to: (i) failure to provide shares of Common Stock upon conversion of the Tilray Convertible Note; (ii) failure to make payments when due under the Tilray Convertible Note; and (iii) bankruptcy or insolvency of the Company. If an event of default on the Tilray Convertible Note occurs, the face value of the Tilray Convertible Note, plus any accrued and unpaid interest and late payments, may become immediately due and payable. Pursuant to the terms of the Tilray Convertible Note, the Company is prohibited from entering into specified transactions involving a change of control, unless the successor entity assumes in writing all of the Company’s obligations under the Tilray Convertible Note under a written agreement. In the event of a transaction involving a change of control at any time prior to the maturity date, the holder of the Tilray Convertible Note will have the right to require us to immediately redeem and repay all or any portion of its Tilray Convertible Note in cash at a price equal to 105% of the then-outstanding principal amount of the Tilray Convertible Note, plus any accrued and unpaid interest and late payments. HEXO Note Immediately prior to the closing of the Transaction, on July 12, 2022, the HEXO Note was amended and restated to reflect, among other things, a maturity date of May 1, 2026, and an initial conversion price of CAN$0.40 per common share, no par value, of HEXO (collectively, the “ HEXO Common Shares ”). The HEXO Note bears interest at a rate of 5.0% per annum, calculated daily, which is payable to Tilray on a semi-annual basis. Interest payments made under the HEXO Note will be made in the form of cash until July 12, 2023. Thereafter, in the event that, on any given interest payment date, HEXO is not in compliance with its minimum liquidity covenant of CAD$70 million, HEXO has the right to add to the then-outstanding principal balance of the note the amount of such interest then due and payable as of such interest payment date. Subject to certain limitations and adjustments as more particularly described therein, the HEXO Note is convertible into HEXO Common Shares at Tilray’s option at any time prior to 5:00 p.m. (Toronto time) on the second scheduled trading day prior to the maturity date, at a conversion price per HEXO Common Share equal to (a) $1,000 divided by (b) the number of HEXO Common Shares equal to (i) $1,000 divided by (ii) the US dollar equivalent of CAD$0.40, as determined the day before execution, per $1,000 outstanding principal amount under the HEXO Note (including all capitalized interest thereon). Pursuant to the terms of a registration rights agreement entered into between the parties on April 11, 2022, HEXO also provided Tilray with customary registration rights in respect of the HEXO Common Shares into which the HEXO Note is convertible. In addition, under the terms of the HEXO Note, Tilray received “top-up” and preemptive rights enabling it to maintain its percentage ownership in HEXO (on an “as-converted” basis) in the event that HEXO issues equity or debt securities following the Closing Date. Provided no default or event of default is then-continuing under the HEXO Note, HEXO is entitled to a right of first refusal to repurchase all or any portion of the HEXO Note that Tilray otherwise proposes to transfer or otherwise dispose of to a non-affiliated third party. The HEXO Note is also subject to the terms of an indenture dated May 27, 2021 (the “ Indenture ”), between HEXO and TMI Trust Company, as the successor to GLAS Trust Company LLC, in its capacity as trustee thereunder. Pursuant to the Transaction Agreement, on the Closing Date, Tilray and HEXO entered into various commercial transaction agreements, including (i) an advisory services agreement regarding Tilray’s provision of advisory services to HEXO in exchange for an $18 million annual advisory fee payable to Tilray; (ii) a co-manufacturing agreement providing for third-party manufacturing services between the parties and setting forth the terms of Tilray’s international bulk supply to HEXO; and (iii) a procurement and cost savings agreement for shared savings related to specified optimization activities, procurement, and other similar cost savings realized by the parties as a result of the foregoing commercial arrangements. In addition, as previously disclosed in the Prior Reports, for so long as any amounts remain outstanding under the HEXO Note or HEXO is a “reporting issuer” within the meaning of the Canadian securities laws, Tilray is entitled, under the terms of the Transaction Agreement, to appoint two of HEXO’s board members and one observer in respect of all meetings, actions and activities of the HEXO board of directors. Denise Faltischek, the Company’s Chief Strategy Officer and Head of International, and Roger Savell, the Company’s Chief Administrative Officer, were designated as Tilray’s initial appointees, and effective as of the Closing Date, have been appointed serve as directors on HEXO’s board of directors.

On December 12, 2019, Tilray, Inc. (“Tilray”) completed its transaction with Privateer Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Privateer”), in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of September 9, 2019 (the “Merger Agreement”) by and among Tilray, Privateer, Down River Merger Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of Tilray (“Merger Sub”) and Michael Blue, as the Stockholder Representative. Pursuant to the terms described in the Merger Agreement, Privateer merged with and into Merger Sub (the “Merger”), with Merger Sub surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Tilray. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each share of Privateer capital stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (excluding shares of Privateer’s capital stock held as treasury stock and dissenters’ shares) were cancelled and automatically converted solely into the right to receive the applicable portion of the merger consideration, calculated in accordance with and as set forth in an allocation certificate as described in more detail in the Merger Agreement, of an aggregate of 56,121,310 shares of Tilray Class 2 common stock and 16,666,665 shares of Tilray Class 1 common stock (inclusive of 6,565,127 shares of Tilray Class 2 common stock held in escrow to be cancelled in satisfaction of any indemnification claims by Tilray under the Merger Agreement, and otherwise for contingent release to Privateer’s stockholders following a period of at least 18 months after the Merger). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Tilray also assumed Privateer’s equity incentive plan and the stock options for Privateer’s capital stock outstanding thereunder immediately prior to the Merger, with such stock options henceforth representing the right to purchase a number of shares of Tilray Class 2 common stock equal to the Option Exchange Ratio, as defined in the Merger Agreement, multiplied by the number of shares of Privateer’s common stock previously represented by such options (the “Assumed Options”). The aggregate number of shares of Tilray Class 2 common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Assumed Options is 3,134,431. Tilray intends to file a Registration Statement on Form S-8 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) with respect to the shares of Tilray Class 2 common stock issuable upon exercise of the Assumed Options. Immediately after the Merger, there were approximately 83,021,590 shares of Tilray Class 2 common stock and 16,666,665 shares of Tilray Class 1 common stock outstanding. Immediately after the Merger, (i) Privateer’s stockholders as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger owned approximately 73% of the outstanding capital stock of Tilray and approximately 89% of the voting power of Tilray and (ii) the three founders of Privateer, namely Brendan Kennedy (Tilray’s Chief Executive Officer and President, as well as a member of the board of directors of Tilray), Michael Blue, and Christian Groh (collectively, the “Founders”), including affiliated individuals and entities, collectively beneficially owned approximately 31% of the outstanding capital stock of Tilray and approximately 72% of the voting power of Tilray. Mr. Kennedy, an executive officer and member of Tilray’s board of directors, was the Executive Chairman, a member of the board of directors and the largest stockholder of Privateer prior to the Merger. Michael Auerbach, a member of Tilray’s board of directors, was a member of the board of directors and a stockholder of Privateer prior to the Merger. The shares of Tilray Class 2 common stock issuable to the former stockholders of Privateer were registered with the SEC on a Registration Statement on Form S-4 (File No. 333-234160), as amended. The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement that was filed as Exhibit 2.1 to Tilray’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on September 10, 2019, and incorporated herein by reference. Item 3.03 Material Modification to Rights of Security Holders. On December 6, 2019, Tilray held a Special Meeting of Stockholders (the “Special Meeting”) at 10:00 a.m., local time, at the offices of Cooley LLP, 1700 Seventh Avenue, Suite 1900, Seattle, Washington 98101-1355. At the Special Meeting, the Tilray stockholders approved the Tilray Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (as amended, the “Tilray Restated Certificate”). On December 12, 2019, in connection with, and immediately following, the Merger, Tilray filed the Tilray Restated Certificate. Pursuant to the Tilray Restated Certificate, each share of Tilray Class 1 common stock is convertible at any time at the option of the holder into one share of Class 2 common stock. In addition, each share of Class 1 common stock will automatically convert into one share of Class 2 common stock upon any transfer, whether or not for value and whether voluntary or involuntary or by operation of law, except for certain transfers described in the Tilray Restated Certificate, including certain transfers for tax and estate planning purposes. The Tilray Restated Certificate eliminated the exception for transfers among Founders, including the exception for the entry into certain voting arrangements among Founders. Upon the date on which the outstanding shares of Class 1 common stock represent less than 10% of the aggregate number of shares of Class 1 common stock and Class 2 common stock then outstanding, all outstanding shares of Class 1 common stock shall convert automatically into shares of Class 2 common stock, and no additional shares of Class 1 common stock will be issued. The foregoing description of the Tilray Restated Certificate does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Tilray Restated Certificate, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 3.1, and incorporated herein by reference.

As previously disclosed in the Current Reports on Form 8-K filed by Tilray Brands, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“ Tilray ”), with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “ SEC ”) on April 10, 2023, as amended on April 11, 2023, and June 2, 2023, Tilray entered into an Arrangement Agreement on April 10, 2023, as amended on June 1, 2023 (the “ Arrangement Agreement ”), with HEXO Corp., a corporation existing under the laws of the Province of Ontario (“ HEXO ”), pursuant to which Tilray agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of HEXO (the “ HEXO Shares ”) as well as all of the issued and outstanding preferred shares of HEXO pursuant to a plan of arrangement (the “ Plan of Arrangement ”) under the Business Corporations Act (Ontario) (the “ Arrangement ”). The Arrangement was consummated on June 22, 2023 (the “ Closing Date ”). Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement Second Supplemental Warrant Indenture to the April 2019 Warrant Indenture On the Closing Date, HEXO, 48North Cannabis Corp. (“ 48North ”), Tilray and Computershare Trust Company of Canada, as warrant agent (the “ April 2019 Warrant Agent ”), entered into the Second Supplemental Warrant Indenture (the “ HEXO April 2019 Second Supplemental Warrant Indenture ”) to the Warrant Indenture (the “ HEXO April 2019 Warrant Indenture ”), dated as of April 2, 2019, 48North and the April 2019 Warrant Agent, as amended by the First Supplemental Warrant Indenture (the “ HEXO April 2019 First Supplemental Warrant Indenture ”), dated as of September 1, 2021, between 48North, HEXO and the April 2019 Warrant Agent, relating to common share purchase warrants of 48North (the “ 48North Warrants ”). Pursuant to the HEXO April 2019 Second Supplemental Warrant Indenture, from and after the effective time of the Plan of Arrangement (the “ Effective Time ”), each 48North Warrant exercisable for HEXO Shares became exercisable for 0.00073549 of a share of common stock of Tilray, par value $0.0001 per share (“ Common Stock ”), at an exercise price of C$1.72 (or an effective exercise price of C$2,338.58 per one whole share of Common Stock), which represents an increase in the exercise price in a corresponding proportion to give effect to the Common Exchange Ratio (as defined below). Each 48North Warrant expires at 5:00pm (Toronto time) on April 2, 2024. No fractional warrants will be issued and the 48North Warrants may only be exercised to acquire whole numbers of shares of Common Stock. Further, if at any time prior to the expiration date of the 48North Warrants, the volume weighted average trading price (the “ VWAP ”) of the Common Stock on the Toronto Stock Exchange (the “ TSX ”) equals or exceeds C$4,486.82 per share of Common Stock for 10 consecutive trading days, Tilray may, within 10 days of such event, deliver written notice to holders of 48North Warrants and the April 2019 Warrant Agent, supplemented by way of a press release issued by Tilray, accelerating the expiration date to the date that is 30 days following the date of such notice.

Item 2.01. Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets. The information provided in the Introductory Note is incorporated by reference herein. Under the terms of the Arrangement Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement, on June 22, 2023, each HEXO Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares held by Tilray and HEXO dissenting shareholders) was transferred to Tilray in exchange for 0.4352 of a share of Common Stock (the “ Common Exchange Ratio ”). Each preferred share of HEXO outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time was transferred to Tilray in exchange for 0.7805 of a share of Common Stock. In the aggregate, HEXO shareholders received 39,710,845 shares of Common Stock (the “ Consideration Shares ”). The Arrangement was intended to qualify as a reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, at the Effective Time, (i) all HEXO equity awards granted under HEXO’s equity compensation plans (the “ HEXO Plans ”) that were outstanding as of the Effective Time were either, depending on the type of equity award, (a) assumed and adjusted to represent a right to acquire Common Stock, with the number of shares underlying such awards and the exercise prices of such awards adjusted based on the Common Exchange Ratio, or (b) exchanged for a cash payment, and (ii) all of the warrants to acquire HEXO Shares that were outstanding as of the Effective Time were adjusted to reflect the terms of the Arrangement, account for the Common Exchange Ratio and represent a right to acquire shares of Common Stock in place of HEXO Shares. Treatment of HEXO Convertible Securities Pursuant to the Arrangement, at the Effective Time, (i) each outstanding option to purchase HEXO Shares, whether vested or unvested, issued pursuant to the HEXO Plans (each, a “ HEXO Option ”), to the extent not exercised as of the Effective Date (as defined in the Arrangement Agreement), was adjusted pursuant to the Arrangement (each, an “ Adjusted Option ”) to represent a right to purchase a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the product of the Common Exchange Ratio multiplied by the number of HEXO Shares issuable on exercise of such HEXO Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, for an exercise price per share of Common Stock equal to the exercise price per share of such HEXO Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Common Exchange Ratio; (ii) each restricted share unit, whether vested or unvested, issued pursuant to the HEXO Plans (each, a “ HEXO RSU ”), to the extent not exercised as of the Effective Date, was exchanged for a cash payment equal to the number of HEXO RSUs credited to such holder multiplied by $1.25 (the “ Payout Value ”) and was immediately thereafter cancelled and terminated; and (iii) each deferred share unit issued pursuant to the HEXO Plans (each, a “ HEXO DSU ”), to the extent not exercised as of the Effective Date, was exchanged for a cash payment equal to the number of HEXO DSUs credited to such holder multiplied by the Payout Value. The HEXO Options shall continue to be governed by the applicable HEXO Plan pursuant to which the HEXO Options were initially granted. The Adjusted Options are convertible into aggregate of 1,283,985 shares of Common Stock. The exercise prices for the Adjusted Options range from C$3.63 to C$1,093.75. Treatment of HEXO Warrants Pursuant to the Arrangement, at the Effective Time, each holder of a Company Warrant (as defined in the Arrangement Agreement), to the extent such Company Warrant had not expired as of the Effective Time and the holder of such Company Warrant had not exercised such Company Warrant as of the Effective Date, became entitled to acquire and receive, upon the exercise of such Company Warrant and payment of the applicable exercise price, the number of shares of Common Stock that would have been issued or paid to such holder if it had exercised such Company Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Company Warrants are, however, subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the applicable warrant indentures and warrant certificates. In addition, each Company Warrant, if applicable, will continue to be governed by and subject to the terms of the applicable warrant indenture or applicable warrant certificate. The foregoing summary description of the completion of the Arrangement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms of (i) the Arrangement Agreement, which was filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by Tilray with the SEC on April 10, 2023 and (ii) the Arrangement Agreement Amendment, which was filed as Exhibit 10.2 to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by Tilray with the SEC on June 2, 2023, and incorporated by reference into this Item 2.01. Item 3.01. Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing. As of the close of trading on June 22, 2023, HEXO, acting pursuant to authorization from its board of directors, voluntarily withdrew the listing of the HEXO Shares from the Nasdaq Stock Market. Item 3.02. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities. The information contained in Item 2.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is hereby incorporated by reference into this Item 3.02. The Consideration Shares issued by Tilray in connection with the consummation of the Arrangement were issued in a transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “ Securities Act ”), pursuant to Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act based on the final order of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice (Commercial List) issued on June 19, 2023, approving the Plan of Arrangement following a hearing by the court which considered, among other things, the fairness of the Arrangement to the persons affected. The issuance of the shares of Common Stock underlying the Adjusted Options will be registered under the Securities Act under a Form S-8 registration statement for the Company’s Amended and Restated 2018 Equity Incentive Plan. The issuance of the shares of Common Stock underlying of the Company Warrants will be registered under the Securities Act under a prospectus supplement related to the Form S-3 registration statement (File No. 333-267788) filed by the Company on October 7, 2022.

Other Events. Arrangement Agreement As previously disclosed on December 15, 2020, Tilray, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Tilray”), and Aphria Inc., a corporation existing under the laws of the Province of Ontario (“Aphria”), entered into an Arrangement Agreement, as amended (the “Arrangement Agreement”), pursuant to which all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Aphria (the “Aphria Shares”) will be exchanged for Class 2 common stock of Tilray, in accordance with a specified exchange ratio, pursuant to a plan of arrangement (the “Plan of Arrangement”) under the Business Corporations Act (Ontario) (the “Arrangement”). In connection with the proposed Arrangement, certain information about Aphria, including a description of its business is filed herewith as Exhibit 99.2 and is incorporated herein by reference. Lock-Up Release As previously announced, on December 12, 2019, Tilray completed its transaction with Privateer Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Privateer”), in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of September 9, 2019 (the “Merger Agreement”) by and among Tilray, Privateer, Down River Merger Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of Tilray and Michael Blue, as the Stockholder Representative. Pursuant to the terms described in the Merger Agreement, Privateer merged with and into Merger Sub (the “Merger”), with Merger Sub surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Tilray. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each Privateer equity holder who received shares of Tilray common stock in the Merger is subject to a lock-up (the “Lock-Up Agreement”) allowing for the sale of such shares only under certain circumstances over a two-year period.

Additional Information and Where to Find It In connection with the proposed transaction, Aphria will file a definitive management information circular, and Tilray will file a definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A containing important information about the proposed transaction and related matters. Additionally, Aphria and Tilray will file other relevant materials in connection with the proposed transaction with the applicable securities regulatory authorities. Investors and security holders of Aphria and Tilray are urged to carefully read the entire management information circular and proxy statement (including any amendments or supplements to such documents), respectively, when such documents become available before making any voting decision with respect to the proposed transaction because they will contain important information about the proposed transaction and the parties to the transaction. The Aphria management information circular and the Tilray proxy statement will be mailed to the Aphria and Tilray shareholders, respectively, as well as be accessible on the SEDAR and EDGAR profiles of the respective companies. Investors and security holders of Tilray will be able to obtain a free copy of the proxy statement, as well as other relevant filings containing information about Tilray and the proposed transaction, including materials that will be incorporated by reference into the proxy statement, without charge, at the SEC’s website (www.sec.gov) or from Tilray by contacting Tilray’s Investor Relations at (203) 682-8253, by email at Raphael.Gross@icrinc.com, or by going to Tilray’s Investor Relations page on its website at https://ir.tilray.com/investor-relations and clicking on the link titled “Financials.” Participants in the Solicitation Tilray and Aphria and certain of their respective directors, executive officers and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of Tilray proxies in respect of the proposed transaction.

Copies of these documents may be obtained, free of charge, from the SEC or Tilray as described in the preceding paragraph. 1 Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements Certain information in this communication constitutes forward-looking information or forward-looking statements (together, “forward-looking statements”) under Canadian securities laws and within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created by such sections and other applicable laws. The forward-looking statements are expressly qualified by this cautionary statement. Any information or statements that are contained in this communication that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements in this communication with regards to: (i) statements relating to Aphria’s and Tilray’s strategic business combination and the expected terms, timing and closing of the Arrangement including, receipt of required regulatory approvals, shareholder approvals, court approvals and satisfaction of other closing customary conditions; (ii) estimates of pro-forma financial information of the combined company, including in respect of expected revenues and production of cannabis; (iii) estimates of future costs applicable to sales; (iv) estimates of future capital expenditures; (v) estimates of future cost reductions, synergies including pre-tax synergies, savings and efficiencies; (vi) statements that the combined company anticipates to have scalable medical and adult-use cannabis platforms expected to strengthen the leadership position in Canada, United States and internationally; (vii) statements that the combined company is expected to offer a diversified and branded product offering and distribution footprint, world-class cultivation, processing and manufacturing facilities; (viii) statements in respect of operational efficiencies expected to be generated as a result of the Arrangement in the amount of more than C$100 million of pre-tax annual cost synergies; (ix) expectations of future balance sheet strength and future equity; and (x) that the combined company is expected to unlock significant shareholder value. Aphria and Tilray use words such as “forecast”, “future”, “should”, “could”, “enable”, “potential”, “contemplate”, “believe”, “anticipate”, “estimate”, “plan”, “expect”, “intend”, “may”, “project”, “will”, “would” and the negative of these terms or similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. Various assumptions were used in drawing the conclusions contained in the forward-looking statements throughout this communication. Forward-looking statements reflect current beliefs of management of Aphria and Tilray with respect to future events and are based on information currently available to each respective management including based on reasonable assumptions, estimates, internal and external analysis and opinions of management of Aphria and Tilray considering their experience, perception of trends, current conditions and expected developments as well as other factors that each respective management believes to be relevant as at the date such statements are made. Forward-looking statements involve significant known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause actual results, performance or achievement to be materially different from any future forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to, risks assumptions and expectations described in Aphria’s and Tilray’s critical accounting policies and estimates; the adoption and impact of certain accounting pronouncements; Aphria’s and Tilray’s future financial and operating performance; the competitive and business strategies of Aphria and Tilray ; the intention to grow the business, operations and potential activities of Aphria and Tilray; the ability of Aphria and Tilray to complete the Arrangement; Aphria’s and Tilray’s ability to provide a return on investment; Aphria’s and Tilray’s ability to maintain a strong financial position and manage costs, the ability of Aphria and Tilray to maximize the utilization of their existing assets and investments and that the completion of the Arrangement is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions as set forth in the Arrangement Agreement. There can be no assurance as to when these conditions will be satisfied or waived, if at all, or that other events will not intervene to delay or result in the failure to complete the Arrangement. There is a risk that some or all the expected benefits of the Arrangement may fail to materialize or may not occur within the time periods anticipated by Aphria and Tilray. The challenge of coordinating previously independent businesses makes evaluating the business and future financial prospects of the combined company following the Arrangement difficult. Material risks that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements also include the inherent uncertainty associated with the financial and other projections; the prompt and effective integration of the combined company; the ability to achieve the anticipated synergies and value-creation contemplated by the proposed transaction; the risk associated with Aphria’s and Tilray’s ability to obtain the approval of the proposed transaction by their shareholders required to consummate the proposed transaction and the timing of the closing of the proposed transaction, including the risk that the conditions to the transaction are not satisfied on a timely basis or at all; the risk that a consent or authorization that may be required for the proposed transaction is not obtained or is obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated; the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against the parties and others related to the Arrangement Agreement; unanticipated difficulties or expenditures relating to the transaction, the response of business partners and retention as a result of the announcement and pendency of the transaction; risks relating to the value of Tilray’s common stock to be issued in connection with the transaction; the impact of competitive responses to the announcement of the transaction; and the diversion of management time on transaction-related issues. For a more detailed discussion of risks and other factors, see the most recently filed annual information form of Aphria and the annual report filed on form 10-K of Tilray made with applicable securities regulatory authorities and available on SEDAR and EDGAR. The forward-looking statements included in this communication are made as of the date of this communication and neither Aphria nor Tilray undertake any obligation to publicly update such forward-looking statements to reflect new information, subsequent events or otherwise unless required by applicable securities laws.

On April 10, 2023, Tilray Brands, Inc. (the “ Company ” or “ Tilray ”) entered into an arrangement agreement (the “ Arrangement Agreement ”) with HEXO Corp. (“ HEXO ”) to acquire all of the outstanding common shares of HEXO (the “ HEXO Shares ”) pursuant to a plan of arrangement (the “ Plan of Arrangement ”) under the Business Corporations Act (Ontario). Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Arrangement Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement, each HEXO Share outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Plan of Arrangement (the “ Effective Time ”) (other than shares, if any, held by HEXO dissenting shareholders) shall be transferred to Tilray in exchange for 0.4352 of a share (the “ Exchange Ratio ”) of Tilray common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Tilray Common Stock”). The arrangement is intended to qualify as a reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes. At the Effective Time, (i) all HEXO equity awards granted under HEXO’s equity compensation plans that are outstanding as of the Effective Time will be adjusted such that the holder thereof will receive Tilray Common Stock, with the number of shares underlying such award (and the exercise price of such award, in the case of options) adjusted based on the Exchange Ratio, and (ii) each of the warrants for HEXO Shares that are outstanding will be adjusted such that the holder thereof will be entitled to receive, upon exercise thereof, Tilray Common Stock after adjustments to reflect the arrangement and to account for the Exchange Ratio. The descriptions of the Arrangement Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are not complete and are subject to, and qualified in their entirety by reference to, the actual agreement, a copy of which is filed with this Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.1, and the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference. The Arrangement Agreement has been attached to provide investors with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about Tilray or HEXO. In particular, the assertions embodied in the representations and warranties in the Arrangement Agreement were made as of the date of the Arrangement Agreement or other specified date, were made for purposes of the contract among the respective parties and are subject to important qualifications and limitations agreed to by the parties in connection with negotiating the Arrangement Agreement, may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from what might be viewed as material to investors, or may have been used for the purpose of allocating risk between the parties. Accordingly, the representations and warranties in the Arrangement Agreement are not necessarily characterizations of the actual state of facts about Tilray or HEXO at the time they were made or otherwise and should only be read in conjunction with the other information that Tilray or HEXO makes publicly available in reports, statements and other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“ SEC ”). In addition, the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements and other terms of the Arrangement Agreement may be subject to subsequent waiver or modification. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties and other terms may change after the date of the Arrangement Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in Tilray or HEXO’s public disclosures. In connection with the Arrangement Agreement, Tilray and HEXO also entered into a letter agreement (the “ Letter Agreement ”) that requires HEXO to pay Tilray an aggregate amount of approximately $18.5 million as an amendment fee and in satisfaction of certain fees and amounts owing by HEXO to Tilray. Pursuant to such Letter Agreement, the parties further agreed to amendments and waivers under that certain Amended and Restated Secured Convertible Note, dated as of July 12, 2022, issued by HEXO and payable to Tilray (the “ HEXO Note ”). These amendments to the HEXO Note include, among other things, a reduction of the HEXO minimum liquidity covenant to $4 million and a waiver of the minimum EBITDA covenant. The Letter Agreement also requires HEXO to make additional payments to Tilray in consideration for the termination of the advisory services agreement dated July 12, 2022 between HEXO and Tilray, up to an amount equal to $10 million. Each of the transactions and agreements described above are subject to several closing conditions, including receipt of HEXO shareholder approval; HEXO undergoing no material adverse events; and HEXO complying with all pre-closing covenant compliance, including limitations on specified business actions. In addition to the transactions and agreements described above, Tilray previously acquired on July 12, 2022 all of the outstanding principal and interest under the HEXO Note with certain amendments. Concurrently with the acquisition by Tilray of the HEXO Note, Tilray and HEXO agreed to enter into commercial agreements providing for co-manufacturing by each of Tilray and HEXO, exclusive supply by Tilray to HEXO of cannabis products for international markets, provisioning by Tilray to HEXO of advisory services and procurement and selling and administrative services. As part of the transaction, Tilray delivered to the seller of the HEXO Note consideration totaling approximately $155 million, representing a substantial investment of resources and capital by the Company. Copies of the transaction documents are filed as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2 with this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by reference. Item 8.01 Other Events.

On March 3, 2022, Tilray Brands, Inc. (the “ Company ” or “ Tilray ”) entered into a sales agreement (the “ Sales Agreement ”) with Jefferies LLC and Canaccord Genuity LLC (each, an “ Agent ” and together, the “ Agents ”), pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell shares of the Company’s Class 2 common stock, par value US$0.0001 per share (the “ Common Stock ”), having an aggregate offering price of up to $400,000,000 from time to time through the Agents, acting as sales agents, or directly to the Agents, acting as principals. Sales of the Common Stock, if any, under the Sales Agreement will be made by any method that is deemed to be an “at the market offering” as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including, but not limited to, sales made directly on or through The Nasdaq Global Select Market or any other existing trading market for the Common Stock. The Company has no obligation to sell any of the Common Stock and may at any time suspend offers under the Sales Agreement or terminate the Sales Agreement. The offering of shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement will terminate upon the earlier of (i) the sale of all Common Stock subject to the Sales Agreement or (ii) termination of the Sales Agreement in accordance with its terms. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Sales Agreement, the Agents will use their commercially reasonable efforts to sell the Common Stock from time to time, as the sales agents, based upon the Company’s instructions. The Company may sell shares of its Common Stock through only one Agent on any particular trading day. No sales of the Common Stock under the Sales Agreement will be made in Canada, to anyone known by the selling Agent to be a resident of Canada or over or through the facilities of the Toronto Stock Exchange. The Company has provided customary representations, warranties and covenants, and the parties have agreed to indemnification rights. Each Agent will be entitled to a commission of up to 3.0% of the gross proceeds for each sale of the Common Stock made through or to such Agent from time to time under the Sales Agreement. This description of the Sales Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms of the Sales Agreement, which is attached as Exhibit 1.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein. The Common Stock to be sold under the Sales Agreement, if any, will be offered and sold pursuant to the Company’s shelf registration statement on Form S-3ASR (File No. 333-233703), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “ SEC ”) on September 11, 2019, which became effective immediately upon filing. On March 3, 2022, the Company filed a prospectus supplement with the SEC in connection with the offer and sale of the Common Stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement. This Current Report on Form 8-K shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the Common Stock nor shall there be any sale of the Common Stock in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or other jurisdiction. The legal opinion of DLA Piper LLP (US) relating to the Common Stock being offered pursuant to the Sales Agreement is filed as Exhibit 5.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. Item 8.01 Other Events. On March 2, 2022, the Company entered into a term sheet (the “Holder Term Sheet”) to acquire all of the outstanding principal balance (along with accrued and unpaid interest) of the secured convertible notes (the “Notes”) issued by Hexo Corp. (“Hexo”) and maturing on May 1, 2023 from the current holder. The total purchase price for the Notes would be in an amount equal to 95% of the current outstanding principal balance (approximately $211 million) plus the accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes (which would be converted into principal prior to closing), together with costs incurred by the Company in connection with the acquisition of the Notes. The purchase price would be payable in cash consideration, Class 2 Common Stock of Tilray or any combination thereof, at the option of Tilray. The Company simultaneously entered into a second term sheet (the “Hexo Term Sheet”) to amend certain terms of the Notes upon acquisition by Tilray. The amendment terms include extending the maturity date by three years to May 1, 2026 and adjusting the initial conversion price of the Notes to Canadian $0.90. The Hexo Term Sheet further provides Tilray with Hexo board governance rights to appoint one director and one board observer. Tilray would be granted “top-up” and preemptive rights enabling it to maintain its percentage ownership (on an “as-converted” basis) in the event that Hexo issues equity or debt securities following acquisition of the Notes by Tilray. The Hexo Term Sheet also provides that Tilray and Hexo would work in good faith to evaluate and implement production efficiencies and cost-saving synergies pursuant to commercial production arrangements to be negotiated by the parties. Each of the transactions described above is subject to negotiation and execution of definitive agreements, satisfactory completion of financial due diligence, receipt of the requisite stock exchange approval by Hexo, board approvals, Hexo shareholder approval and other customary conditions.

As previously disclosed in the Current Reports on Form 8-K filed by Tilray, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“ Tilray ”), with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “ SEC ”) on December 21, 2020 and February 22, 2021, Tilray entered into an Arrangement Agreement on December 15, 2020, as amended on February 19, 2021 (the “ Arrangement Agreement ”), with Aphria Inc., a corporation existing under the laws of the Province of Ontario (“ Aphria ”), pursuant to which Tilray agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Aphria (the “ Aphria Shares ”) pursuant to a plan of arrangement (the “ Plan of Arrangement ”) under the Business Corporations Act (Ontario) (the “ Arrangement ”). The Arrangement was consummated on April 30, 2021 (the “ Closing Date ”). Item 2.01. Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets. The information provided in the Introductory Note is incorporated by reference herein. Under the terms of the Arrangement Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement, on April 30, 2021, each Aphria Share outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Arrangement (the “ Effective Time ”) was transferred to Tilray in exchange for 0.8381 of a share (the “ Exchange Ratio ”) of Class 2 common stock of Tilray, par value $0.0001 per share (“ Class 2 Common Stock ”). In the aggregate, Aphria shareholders received 266,804,667 shares of Class 2 Common Stock (the “ Consideration Shares ”). The Exchange Ratio was agreed to on December 15, 2020 and was not adjusted for any subsequent changes in market price of the Class 2 Common Stock or the Aphria Shares prior to the Closing Date. The Arrangement was intended to qualify as a reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, at the Effective Time, (i) all Aphria equity awards granted under Aphria’s equity compensation plans (the “ Aphria Plans ”) as of the Effective Time were assumed and exchanged into corresponding awards with respect to Class 2 Common Stock, with the number of shares underlying such awards (and the exercise prices of such awards, in the case of options) adjusted based on the Exchange Ratio, (ii) all of the warrants to acquire Aphria Shares issued in 2016, to the extent not exercised as of the Effective Time, were exchanged into warrants to acquire shares of Class 2 Common Stock after adjustments to reflect the terms of the Arrangement, and (iii) all remaining warrants to acquire Aphria Shares remained outstanding and became exercisable, in accordance with their respective terms, for Class 2 Common Stock, after adjustments to reflect the terms of the Arrangement. Treatment of Aphria Convertible Securities Pursuant to the Arrangement, at the Effective Time, (i) each outstanding option to purchase Aphria Shares (each, an “ Aphria Option ”) issued pursuant to the Aphria Plans , to the extent it had not been exercised as of the Effective Date (as defined in the Arrangement Agreement), was exchanged for a stock option (each, a “ Replacement Option ”) to purchase a number of shares of Class 2 Common Stock equal to the product of the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to two decimal places, multiplied by the number of Aphria Shares issuable on exercise of such Aphria Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (rounded down to the next whole number of shares of Class 2 Common Stock) for an exercise price per share of Class 2 Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the exercise price per share of such Aphria Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to two decimal places; (ii) each restricted share unit issued under the Aphria Plans (each, an “ Aphria RSU ”) to the extent it had not been exercised as of the Effective Date, was exchanged for a restricted stock unit of Tilray (each, a “ Replacement RSU ”) in respect of a number of shares of Class 2 Common Stock equal to the product of the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to two decimal places, multiplied by the number of Aphria Shares underlying such Aphria RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time (rounded down to the next whole number of shares of Class 2 Common Stock); and (iii) each deferred share unit of Aphria issued pursuant to the Aphria Plans (each, an “ Aphria DSU ”), to the extent it had not been exercised as of the Effective Date, was exchanged for a deferred share unit of Tilray (the “ Replacement DSUs ”) in respect of a number of shares of Class 2 Common Stock equal to the product of the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to two decimal places, multiplied by the number of Aphria Shares underlying such Aphria DSU immediately prior to the Effective Time (rounded down to the next whole number of shares of Class 2 Common Stock). The terms, conditions and manner of exercise and other terms and conditions of each of the Replacement Options, the Replacement RSUs, and the Replacement DSUs are the same as the terms and conditions of the respective Aphria Options, Aphria RSUs or Aphria DSUs for which they were exchanged, except that such Replacement Options, Replacement RSUs and Replacement DSUs are governed by the terms and conditions of the Tilray, Inc. Amended and Restated 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the “ Tilray Plan ”). The Replacement Options, Replacements RSUs and Replacement DSUs are convertible into aggregate of 6,461,092 shares of Class 2 Common Stock. The exercise prices for the Replacement Options range from C$1.69 to C$27.58. The settlement of Replacement RSUs and Replacement DSUs vary, occurring within a short-term deferral period after either the satisfaction of time- or performance-based conditions or upon a deferred settlement date (including but not limited to termination of service or upon election) as permitted under the applicable award agreement. Treatment of Aphria Warrants Pursuant to the Arrangement, at the Effective Time, each 2016 Aphria Warrant (as defined in the Arrangement Agreement), to the extent it had not been exercised as of the Effective Date, was exchanged for a warrant (a “ Replacement Warrant ”) to purchase a number of shares of Class 2 Common Stock equal to the product of the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to two decimal places, multiplied by the number of Aphria Shares issuable on exercise of such Aphria Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time for an exercise price per share of Class 2 Common Stock equal to the exercise price per share of such Aphria Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to two decimal places, and rounded up to the nearest whole cent (provided that, to the extent the foregoing calculation resulted in a Replacement Warrant being exercisable for a fraction of a share of Class 2 Common Stock, then the number of shares of Class 2 Common Stock subject to such Replacement Warrant was rounded down to the next whole number of shares of Class 2 Common Stock). After giving effect to the foregoing adjustments, an aggregate amount of 166,000 Replacement Warrants, with an expiration date of September 19, 2021, were issued at an exercise price of $3.79 in connection with the consummation of the Arrangement. The terms, conditions and manner of exercise for each of the Replacement Warrants are otherwise the same as the terms and conditions of the 2016 Aphria Warrant for which it was exchanged. At the Effective Time, each 2020 Aphria Warrant (as defined in the Arrangement Agreement) was continued on the same terms and conditions as were applicable immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that, pursuant to the terms of the Aphria Warrant Indenture (as defined in the Arrangement Agreement), the terms of the 2020 Aphria Warrants were amended so as to substitute for the Aphria Shares subject to such 2020 Aphria Warrants such number of shares of Class 2 Common stock equal to (A) the number of Aphria Shares subject to the 2020 Aphria Warrants immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to two decimal places. The foregoing summary description of the completion of the Arrangement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms of the Arrangement Agreement, which was filed as Exhibit 2.1 to the Current Reports on Form 8-K filed by Tilray with the SEC on December 21, 2020 and February 22, 2021, and is incorporated by reference into this Item 2.01. Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant. Aphria Supplemental Indenture On the Closing Date, Aphria, Tilray and GLAS Trust Company LLC, as trustee (the “ Trustee ”), entered into the First Supplemental Indenture (the “ Aphria Supplemental Indenture ”) to the Indenture dated as of April 23, 2019 (the “ Aphria Indenture ”), between Aphria and the Trustee, relating to Aphria’s 5.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 (the “ Aphria Convertible Notes ”). As of the date hereof, approximately $259.24 million aggregate principal amount of the Aphria Convertible Notes is outstanding. The Aphria Supplemental Indenture provides that, from and after the Effective Time (as defined in the Aphria Supplemental Indenture), the right to convert each $1,000 principal amount of the Aphria Convertible Notes into a number of Aphria Shares under the Aphria Indenture became a right to convert such principal amount of the Aphria Convertible Notes into a number of units of Reference Property (as defined in the Aphria Supplemental Indenture) equal to the conversion rate then in effect, subject to Aphria’s right to settle any conversion of Aphria Convertible Notes in units of Reference Property, cash or any combination thereof. Upon consummation of the Arrangement, the conversion rate of the Aphria Convertible Notes was 0.8381 units of Reference Property. In addition, Tilray agreed to guarantee Aphria’s obligations under the Aphria Indenture and the Aphria Convertible Notes as provided in the Aphria Supplemental Indenture. The foregoing description of the Aphria Supplemental Indenture is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Aphria Indenture and the Aphria Supplemental Indenture, copies of which are filed as Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2 hereto, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference. Item 2.04. Triggering Events That Accelerate or Increase a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement. The information set forth under Item 2.03 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated by reference into this Item 2.04. The closing of the Arrangement Agreement triggered the right of holders of Aphria Convertible Notes to convert such notes into Class 2 Common Stock pursuant to the terms of the Aphria Indenture, as amended by the Aphria Supplemental Indenture. Item 3.01. Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing. As of the close of trading on April 30, 2021, Aphria, acting pursuant to authorization from its board of directors voluntarily withdrew the listing of the Aphria Common Shares from the Nasdaq Global Select Market. Item 3.02. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities. The information contained in Item 2.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is hereby incorporated by reference into this Item 3.02. The Consideration Shares, the Replacement Options, the Replacement RSUs, the Replacement DSUs and the Replacement Warrants issued by Tilray in connection with the consummation of the Arrangement were issued in a transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “ Securities Act ”), pursuant to Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act based on the final order of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice (Commercial List) issued on April 19, 2021, approving the Plan of Arrangement following a hearing by the court which considered, among other things, the fairness of the Arrangement to the persons affected. The issuance of the shares of Class 2 Common Stock underlying the Replacement Options, the Replacement RSUs and the Replacement DSUs will be registered under the Securities Act under a Form S-8 registration statement for the Company’s Amended and Restated 2018 Equity Incentive Plan. The issuance of the shares of Class 2 Common Stock underlying of the Replacement Warrants will be exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act provided by Section 4(a)(2) thereof, Rule 506(b) of Regulation D thereunder or Rule 903 of Regulation S thereunder, or any other available exemption, in each case, in accordance with the representations of the holder thereof at the time of exercise. On April 29, 2021, Tilray issued 258,799 shares of Class 2 Common Stock to Wyckoff in connection with a settlement agreement and release.

Entry into a Material Definition Agreement. Arrangement Agreement On December 15, 2020, Tilray, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Tilray”), and Aphria Inc., a corporation existing under the laws of the Province of Ontario (“Aphria”), entered into an Arrangement Agreement (the “Arrangement Agreement”), pursuant to which Tilray will acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Aphria (the “Aphria Shares”) pursuant to a plan of arrangement (the “Plan of Arrangement”) under the Business Corporations Act (Ontario) (the “Arrangement”). Consideration Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Arrangement Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement, each Aphria Share outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Arrangement (the “Effective Time”) (other than the shares held by Aphria dissenting shareholders) shall be transferred to Tilray in exchange for 0.8381 of a share (the “Exchange Ratio”) of Tilray Class 2 common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Tilray Common Stock”). The Arrangement is intended to qualify as a reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes. At the Effective Time, (i) all Aphria equity awards granted under Aphria’s equity compensation plans that are outstanding as of the Effective Time will be exchanged into a corresponding award with respect to Tilray Common Stock, with the number of shares underlying such award (and the exercise price of such award, in the case of options) adjusted based on the Exchange Ratio, (ii) each of the warrants to acquire Aphria Shares issued in 2016 will be exchanged into warrants to acquire Tilray Common Stock after adjustments to reflect the Arrangement and to account for the Exchange Ratio, and (iii) all remaining warrants to acquire Aphria Shares will remain outstanding and will be exercisable, in accordance with the terms, for Tilray Common Stock, after adjustments to reflect the Arrangement and to account for the Exchange Ratio. Governance The Arrangement Agreement provides that Tilray will increase the number of directors that comprise the Tilray board of directors (the “Tilray Board”) at the Effective Time to nine directors. The members of Tilray Board will be comprised of (i) the seven existing Aphria board members, (ii) the chief executive officer of Tilray, and (iii) one remaining director to be designated by the Tilray Board, provided that no less than two-thirds of the Tilray Board will be either Canadian citizens or permanent residents of Canada. The chief executive officer of Aphria will become the chief executive officer of Tilray at the Effective Time. Conditions to the Arrangement The obligations of the Tilray and Aphria to consummate the Arrangement are subject to customary conditions, including, but not limited to, (a) obtaining the required approvals of Tilray’s and Aphria’s shareholders, (b) obtaining an interim order and final order (the “Final Order”) from the Ontario Superior Court of Justice approving the Arrangement, (c) the absence of any injunction or similar restraint prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the Arrangement or any of the other transactions contemplated by the Arrangement Agreement, (d) the required regulatory approvals having been obtained, (e) no material adverse effect having occurred, (f) subject to certain materiality exceptions, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of each party and (g) the performance in all material respects by each party of its obligations under the Arrangement Agreement. Certain Other Terms of the Arrangement Agreement The Arrangement Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants of Tilray and Aphria and each party has agreed to customary covenants, including, among others, covenants relating to (1) the conduct of its business during the interim period between execution of the Arrangement Agreement and the Effective Time and (2) non-solicitation obligations in connection with alternative acquisition proposals (however, under certain circumstances, a party may change its recommendation to its stockholders in response to a superior proposal or accept such a superior proposal if such party’s board of directors, among other things, determines in good faith that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties). The Arrangement Agreement contains certain termination rights for each of Tilray and Aphria, including in the event that (i) the Arrangement has not occurred on or before July 31, 2020 (the “Outside Date”), which Outside Date may be extended for up to 60 days in the event that the regulatory closing conditions have not been satisfied or the Final Order has not been obtained, (ii) the approval of (a) the resolution approving the Arrangement (the “Arrangement Resolution”) by Aphria’s shareholders or (b)(1) adoption of the revised organizational documents, (2) the amended Tilray omnibus plan and (3) the issuance of the consideration shares (collectively, the “Titan Resolutions”) by Tilray’s shareholders, in each case as applicable, is not obtained at the respective shareholder meetings or (iii) if any restraint having the effect of preventing the consummation of the Arrangement shall have become final and nonappealable. In addition, Tilray and Aphria can each terminate the Arrangement Agreement prior to the shareholder meeting of the other party if, among other things, the other party’s board of directors has changed its recommendation that its shareholders approve the Arrangement Resolution or Tilray Resolutions, as applicable, or has failed to make or reaffirm such recommendation in certain circumstances. The Arrangement Agreement provides further that a termination fee will be payable by Tilray or Aphria, as the case may be, upon termination of the Arrangement Agreement under specified circumstances, including: (i) a change in the recommendation of the board of directors of the other party or a material breach by the other party of the non-solicitation covenants; (ii) the other party’s pursuit of a superior proposal; or (iii) a termination of the Arrangement Agreement by Tilray or Aphria, as applicable, because of (a) a failure of the shareholders of the other party to adopt the Arrangement Resolution or Tilray Resolutions, as applicable, at the respective shareholder meetings or (b) a willful breach by the other party of its representations and warranties or covenants under the Arrangement Agreement, in each case set forth in this clause (iii) at a time when there was a publicly announced or publicly disclosed offer or proposal for an alternative transaction with respect to such party and such party enters into or consummates an alternative transaction within 12 months following such date of termination. In the event such termination fee is payable by Tilray or Aphria, Tilray will be required to pay Aphria or Aphria will be required to pay Tilray a termination fee of CD$65 million.

The foregoing description of the Arrangement Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Arrangement Agreement.

In addition, such representations and warranties (1) will not survive completion of the Arrangement and cannot be the basis for any claims under the Arrangement Agreement by the other party after termination of the Arrangement Agreement and (2) were made only as of the dates specified in the Arrangement Agreement. Accordingly, the Arrangement Agreement is included with this filing only to provide investors with information regarding the terms of the Arrangement Agreement and not to provide investors with any other factual information regarding the parties or their respective businesses. Support Agreements Simultaneously with the execution of the Arrangement Agreement, Tilray and certain holders of Aphria Shares (the “Aphria Support Agreement Shareholders”) have entered into a voting and support agreement (the “Tilray Support Agreement”), pursuant to which the Aphria Support Agreement Shareholders agreed, among other things, to vote their Aphria Shares in favor of the adoption of the Arrangement Agreement and against any alternative proposal.

Also simultaneously with the execution of the Arrangement Agreement, Aphria and certain holders of Tilray Common Stock (the “Tilray Support Agreement Shareholders”) have entered into a voting and support agreement (the “Aphria Support Agreement”), pursuant to which the Tilray Support Agreement Shareholders agreed, among other things, to vote their shares of Tilray Common Stock in favor of the adoption of the Arrangement Agreement and against any alternative proposal. The Aphria Support Agreements terminate upon the occurrence of certain events, including the termination of the Arrangement Agreement in accordance with its terms.

The Letter of Resignation also includes a form of release agreement to be entered into between Mr. Kennedy and Tilray as of the Effective Time, that, together with the Letter of Resignation, amends certain rights that Mr. Kennedy has in under his employment agreement in consideration for the benefits that Mr. Kennedy may receive as a result of the completion of the Arrangement, including a severance payment and full accelerated vesting of all equity awards. The Letter of Resignation will become null and void if the Arrangement Agreement terminates without the closing of the Arrangement having occurred. The foregoing description of the Letter of Resignation does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Letter of Resignation, which is attached as Exhibit 5.02 to this Current Report and incorporated herein by reference.

Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements Certain information in this communication constitutes forward-looking information or forward-looking statements (together, “forward-looking statements”) under Canadian securities laws and within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created by such sections and other applicable laws. The forward-looking statements are expressly qualified by this cautionary statement. Any information or statements that are contained in this communication that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements in this communication with regards to: (i) statements relating to Aphria’s and Tilray’s strategic business combination and the expected terms, timing and closing of the Arrangement including, receipt of required regulatory approvals, shareholder approvals, court approvals and satisfaction of other closing customary conditions; (ii) estimates of pro-forma financial information of the combined company, including in respect of expected revenues and production of cannabis; (iii) estimates of future costs applicable to sales; (iv) estimates of future capital expenditures; (v) estimates of future cost reductions, synergies including pre-tax synergies, savings and efficiencies; (vi) statements that the combined company anticipates to have scalable medical and adult-use cannabis platforms expected to strengthen the leadership position in Canada, United States and internationally; (vii) statements that the combined company is expected to offer a diversified and branded product offering and distribution footprint, world-class cultivation, processing and manufacturing facilities; (viii) statements in respect of operational efficiencies expected to be generated as a result of the Arrangement in the amount of more than C$100 million of pre-tax annual cost synergies; (ix) expectations of future balance sheet strength and future equity; (x) that the combined company is expected to unlock significant shareholder value; and (xi) statements under the heading “Strategic and Financial Benefits” of this communication. Aphria and Tilray use words such as “forecast”, “future”, “should”, “could”, “enable”, “potential”, “contemplate”, “believe”, “anticipate”, “estimate”, “plan”, “expect”, “intend”, “may”, “project”, “will”, “would” and the negative of these terms or similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. Various assumptions were used in drawing the conclusions contained in the forward-looking statements throughout this communication. Forward-looking statements reflect current beliefs of management of Aphria and Tilray with respect to future events and are based on information currently available to each respective management including based on reasonable assumptions, estimates, internal and external analysis and opinions of management of Aphria and Tilray considering their experience, perception of trends, current conditions and expected developments as well as other factors that each respective management believes to be relevant as at the date such statements are made. Forward-looking statements involve significant known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause actual results, performance or achievement to be materially different from any future forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to, risks assumptions and expectations described in Aphria’s and Tilray’s critical accounting policies and estimates; the adoption and impact of certain accounting pronouncements; Aphria’s and Tilray’s future financial and operating performance; the competitive and business strategies of Aphria and Tilray ; the intention to grow the business, operations and potential activities of Aphria and Tilray; the ability of Aphria and Tilray to complete the Arrangement; Aphria’s and Tilray’s ability to provide a return on investment; Aphria’s and Tilray’s ability to maintain a strong financial position and manage costs, the ability of Aphria and Tilray to maximize the utilization of their existing assets and investments and that the completion of the Arrangement is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions as set forth in the Arrangement Agreement. There can be no assurance as to when these conditions will be satisfied or waived, if at all, or that other events will not intervene to delay or result in the failure to complete the Arrangement. There is a risk that some or all the expected benefits of the Arrangement may fail to materialize or may not occur within the time periods anticipated by Aphria and Tilray. The challenge of coordinating previously independent businesses makes evaluating the business and future financial prospects of the combined company following the Arrangement difficult. Material risks that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements also include the inherent uncertainty associated with the financial and other projections; the prompt and effective integration of the combined company; the ability to achieve the anticipated synergies and value-creation contemplated by the proposed transaction; the risk associated with Aphria’s and Tilray’s ability to obtain the approval of the proposed transaction by their shareholders required to consummate the proposed transaction and the timing of the closing of the proposed transaction, including the risk that the conditions to the transaction are not satisfied on a timely basis or at all; the risk that a consent or authorization that may be required for the proposed transaction is not obtained or is obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated; the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against the parties and others related to the Arrangement Agreement; unanticipated difficulties or expenditures relating to the transaction, the response of business partners and retention as a result of the announcement and pendency of the transaction; risks relating to the value of Tilray’s common stock to be issued in connection with the transaction; the impact of competitive responses to the announcement of the transaction; and the diversion of management time on transaction-related issues. For a more detailed discussion of risks and other factors, see the most recently filed annual information form of Aphria and the annual report filed on form 10-K of Tilray made with applicable securities regulatory authorities and available on SEDAR and EDGAR. The forward-looking statements included in this communication are made as of the date of this communication and neither Aphria nor Tilray undertake any obligation to publicly update such forward-looking statements to reflect new information, subsequent events or otherwise unless required by applicable securities laws.

On March 12, 2020, Tilray filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and commenced the mailing of a definitive joint proxy statement/circular (the “Proxy Statement/Circular”) with respect to the special meeting of Tilray stockholders scheduled to be held on April 16, 2021 pursuant to the Arrangement (the “Tilray Special Meeting”). Supplemental Disclosures to the Proxy Statement/Circular This Current Report on Form 8-K (this “Form 8-K”) is being filed to update and supplement the Proxy Statement/Circular. The information contained in this Form 8-K is incorporated by reference into the Proxy Statement/Circular. Terms used in this Form 8-K, but not otherwise defined, shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Proxy Statement/Circular. Following the announcement of the Arrangement Agreement and as of the date of this Form 8-K, seven lawsuits have been filed by alleged stockholders of Tilray: (i) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Violini v.

The proposed ownership splits of 62.5% / 37.5% contemplated the dilution from the convertible note exchange.

For each company, Imperial estimated terminal value using both the TEV/EBITDA multiple method and the Perpetuity Growth Method. For the TEV/EBITDA method, based upon its professional judgment and knowledge of the companies’ industry, Imperial applied a range of TEV/EBITDA multiples (20x to 22x for Tilray and 5 18x to 20x for Aphria) to the final fiscal year EBITDA in the company’s projections. For the Perpetuity Growth method, based upon its professional judgment and knowledge of the companies’ industry, Imperial applied a range of perpetuity growth rates (8.5% to 9.5%) to the free cash flow in the final fiscal year of the company’s projections. Imperial then discounted the operating cash flows and terminal values to present values using a discount rate of 12.5% (based upon calculations of the weighted average cost of capital for Aphria and Tilray). This analysis resulted in the following equity value ranges for Aphria and Tilray (after subtracting the net debt of $246 million and $170 million, respectively ) (US$ in millions): The disclosure under the heading “Tilray Management Financial Projections” on page 92 of the Proxy Statement/Circular is hereby amended and supplemented by replacing the table and accompanying footnotes on page 92 with the following: The following table presents certain unaudited prospective financial information of Tilray prepared by Tilray management for fiscal years 2020 through 2023, for the Tilray Board, Cowen, Imperial, Jefferies and Aphria, and approved by the Tilray Board for use by Cowen and Imperial in connection with rendering a fairness opinion to the Tilray Board.

Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements Certain information in this Form 8-K constitutes forward-looking information or forward-looking statements (together, “forward-looking statements”) under Canadian securities laws and within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created by such sections and other applicable laws. The forward-looking statements are expressly qualified by this cautionary statement. Forward-looking statements are provided for the purpose of presenting information about management’s current expectations and plans relating to the future, and readers are cautioned that such statements may not be appropriate for other purposes. Any information or statements that are contained in this Form 8-K that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements in this Form 8-K with regards to: (i) statements relating to the strategic business combination of Aphria and Tilray and the expected timing and closing of the Transaction; Transaction including, receipt of required shareholder approvals, court approvals and satisfaction of other closing customary conditions; (ii) estimates of pro-forma financial information of the Combined Company, including in respect of expected revenues and production of cannabis; (iii) the expected strategic and financial benefits of the business combination, including estimates of future cost reductions, synergies, including expected pre-tax synergies, savings and efficiencies; (iv) statements that the Combined Company anticipates having scalable medical and adult-use cannabis platforms expected to strengthen the leadership position in Canada, internationally and, eventually in the United States; (v) statements that the Combined Company is expected to offer a diversified and branded product offering and distribution footprint, state-of-the-art cultivation, processing and manufacturing facilities; (vi) statements in respect of operational efficiencies expected to be generated as a result of the Transaction in the amount of approximately C$100 million of pre-tax annual cost synergies; (vii) statements regarding the value and returns to shareholders expected to be generated by the business combination; (viii) expectations of future balance sheet strength and future equity; (ix) expectations regarding the Combined Company’s future M&A strategy; and (x) the expectation that the Combined Company’s shares will be listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange concurrently with, or as soon as possible after, the closing of the Transaction. Aphria and Tilray use words such as “forecast”, “future”, “should”, “could”, “enable”, “potential”, “contemplate”, “believe”, “anticipate”, “estimate”, “plan”, “expect”, “intend”, “may”, “project”, “will”, “would” and the negative of these terms or similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. Certain material factors or assumptions were used in drawing the conclusions contained in the forward-looking statements throughout this Form 8-K, including the ability of the parties to receive, in a timely manner and on satisfactory terms, the necessary shareholder 10 and court approvals for the Transaction, the ability of the parties to satisfy, in a timely manner, the conditions to closing of the Transaction and other expectations and assumptions concerning the Transaction. Forward-looking statements reflect current beliefs of management of Aphria and Tilray with respect to future events and are based on information currently available to each respective management team including the reasonable assumptions, estimates, analysis and opinions of management of Aphria and Tilray considering their experience, perception of trends, current conditions and expected developments as well as other factors that each respective management believes to be relevant as at the date such statements are made. Forward-looking statements involve significant known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause actual results, performance or achievement to be materially different from any future forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to, risks assumptions and expectations described in Aphria’s and Tilray’s critical accounting policies and estimates; the adoption and impact of certain accounting pronouncements; Aphria’s and Tilray’s future financial and operating performance; the competitive and business strategies of Aphria and Tilray; the intention to grow the business, operations and potential activities of Aphria and Tilray; the ability of Aphria and Tilray to complete the Transaction; Aphria’s and Tilray’s ability to provide a return on investment; Aphria’s and Tilray’s ability to maintain a strong financial position and manage costs, the ability of Aphria and Tilray to maximize the utilization of their existing assets and investments and that the completion of the Transaction is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions as set forth in the Arrangement Agreement. There can be no assurance as to when these conditions will be satisfied or waived, if at all, or that other events will not intervene to delay or result in the failure to complete the Transaction. There is a risk that some or all the expected benefits of the Transaction may fail to materialize or may not occur within the time periods anticipated by Aphria and Tilray. The challenge of coordinating previously independent businesses makes evaluating the business and future financial prospects of the Combined Company following the Transaction difficult. Material risks that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements also include the inherent uncertainty associated with the financial and other projections a well as market changes arising from governmental actions or market conditions in response to the COVID-19 public health crisis; the prompt and effective integration of the Combined Company; the ability to achieve the anticipated synergies and value-creation contemplated by the Transaction; the risk associated with Aphria’s and Tilray’s ability to obtain the approval of the proposed transaction by their shareholders required to consummate the Transaction and the timing of the closing of the Transaction, including the risk that the conditions to the Transaction are not satisfied on a timely basis or at all; the risk that a consent or authorization that may be required for the Transaction is not obtained or is obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated; the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against the parties and others related to the Arrangement Agreement; unanticipated difficulties or expenditures relating to the Transaction, the response of business partners and retention as a result of the announcement and pendency of the Transaction; risks relating to the value of Tilray’s common stock to be issued in connection with the transaction; the impact of competitive responses to the announcement of the Transaction; and the diversion of management time on transaction-related issues. Readers are cautioned that the foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive. Other risks and uncertainties not presently known to Aphria and Tilray or that Aphria and Tilray presently believe are not material could also cause actual results or events to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements contained herein. For a more detailed discussion of risks and other factors, see the most recently filed annual information form of Aphria and the annual report filed on form 10-K of Tilray made with applicable securities regulatory authorities and available on SEDAR and EDGAR. The forward-looking statements included in this Form 8-K are made as of the date of this Form 8-K and neither Aphria nor Tilray undertake any obligation to publicly update such forward-looking statements to reflect new information, subsequent events or otherwise unless required by applicable securities laws. 11 SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

(collectively, the “Lender”), certain guarantors and the Borrower (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Senior Credit Facility”). As a result of COVID-19 related financial markets conditions that have affected the Lender, and not because of any material changes to the business of Tilray or its subsidiaries, the Lender requested that Tilray withdraw its outstanding request for the additional funding of $9.9 million under the Senior Credit Facility. In exchange for Tilray’s accommodation of the Lender’s request to withdraw its funding request, the Lender agreed to enter into the First Amendment of the Senior Credit Facility. Among other things, the First Amendment provides that the Senior Credit Facility will only require interest payments for the remainder of its term. All outstanding principal payments will be due at maturity, February 28, 2022. Additionally, and at such time as the Lender’s business may allow, the Lender may make the additional proceeds of $9.9 million available during the term of the Credit Agreement, at its sole discretion. Tilray has been, and is currently, in full compliance with all terms of the Senior Credit Facility and will not incur any fees or penalties in connection with the First Amendment. Concurrently, with the First Amendment, the Lender also approved Tilray’s ability to sell the High Park Gardens facility, if and when Tilray so desires. As part of any sale of the High Park Gardens facility, the Lender has agreed that the Borrower may retain 60% of any sales proceeds (net of all expenses, fees and taxes), and that the Lender shall receive 40% of all sales proceeds (net of all expenses, fees and taxes). All sales proceeds to the Lender will be applied as a repayment of principal on the Senior Credit Facility, without any prepayment penalties or fees. The foregoing description of the First Amendment is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the First Amendment, which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement Tilray, Inc. (“ Tilray ”) and certain strategic investors formed a new Delaware limited partnership, Superhero Acquisition L.P. (“ Acquisition Co. ”), for the sole purpose of acquiring approximately US$165.8 million principal amount of senior secured convertible notes (the “ Notes ”) originally issued by MedMen Enterprises Inc. (“ MedMen ”) and certain warrants (the “ Warrants ”) to acquire Class B subordinate voting shares (the “ MedMen Shares ”) issued in connection with the original issuance of the Notes. Pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption Agreement dated as of August 17, 2021, Acquisition Co. completed its acquisition (the “ Transaction ”) of the Notes and Warrants from certain funds affiliated with Gotham Green Partners (collectively, “ GGP ”). As consideration for the Notes and Warrants, subject to Tilray receiving the requisite stockholder approval necessary to increase the number of shares of its authorized capital stock (the “ Requisite Approval ”), Tilray will issue approximately 9.0 million shares of its common stock (the “ Consideration Shares ”) to GGP. In the event that Tilray does not obtain the Requisite Approval necessary for the issuance of the Consideration Shares prior to December 1, 2021, GGP may elect to receive cash in lieu of the Consideration Shares. Tilray also agreed to provide GGP with customary resale registration rights in respect of the Consideration Shares and provided GGP with the potential to receive additional Consideration Shares in the event that the per-share closing price of Tilray’s outstanding common stock (the “ Reference Price ”) on the trading day immediately preceding the earlier of (i) the date that the registration statement regarding the resale of the Consideration Shares is declared effective and (ii) December 1, 2021, is less than the Reference Price on the trading day immediately preceding the public announcement of the Transaction. Prior to Acquisition Co’s purchase of the Notes and Warrants, MedMen entered into certain amendments to these securities with GGP to facilitate Acquisition Co.’s acquisition of its interest in these securities in compliance with applicable securities laws and stock exchange rules. As a result of the Transaction, Tilray indirectly acquired a right to 68% of the Notes and the Warrants held by Acquisition Co, representing an interest of approximately 21% of the outstanding MedMen Shares on the closing date of the Transaction (assuming such Notes and Warrants were converted and exercised upon closing the Transaction). Acquisition Co. was also granted “top-up” rights enabling it (and its limited partners) to maintain its percentage ownership (on an “as-converted” basis) in the event that MedMen issues equity securities upon conversion of convertible securities that may be issued by MedMen. The Notes and Warrants may be exercised by Acquisition Co. (or Tilray if Tilray elects to have the Notes and/or Warrants it beneficially owns distributed from Acquisition Co.) following the date that the federal laws in the United States are amended to permit the general cultivation, distribution and possession of cannabis or to remove the regulation of such activities from the federal laws of the United States (a “ Triggering Event ”) or upon Tilray’s waiver of a Triggering Event, subject to the provisions of the Notes and Warrants and the agreements related thereto. Item 3.02 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities. The disclosure in Item 1.01 of this Form 8-K is incorporated into this Item 3.02 by reference. The Consideration Shares issuable upon receipt of the requisite stockholder approval necessary to increase the number of shares of its authorized capital stock will be issued in reliance on the exemption provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act for the offer and sale of securities not involving a public offering.

CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain information in this communication constitutes forward-looking information or forward-looking statements (together, “forward-looking statements”) under Canadian securities laws and within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created by such sections and other applicable laws. The forward-looking statements are expressly qualified by this cautionary statement. Forward-looking statements are provided for the purpose of presenting information about management’s current expectations and plans relating to the future, and readers are cautioned that such statements may not be appropriate for other purposes. Any information or statements that are contained in this communication that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements in this communication with regards to: (i) statements relating to the strategic business combination of Aphria and Tilray and the expected timing and closing of the proposed business combination (the “Transaction”); Transaction including, receipt of required shareholder approvals, court approvals and satisfaction of other closing customary conditions; (ii) estimates of pro-forma financial information of the Combined Company, including in respect of expected revenues and production of cannabis; (iii) the expected strategic and financial benefits of the business combination, including estimates of future cost reductions, synergies, including expected pre-tax synergies, savings and efficiencies; (iv) statements that the Combined Company anticipates having scalable medical and adult-use cannabis platforms expected to strengthen the leadership position in Canada, internationally and, eventually in the United States; (v) statements that the Combined Company is expected to offer a diversified and branded product offering and distribution footprint, state-of-the-art cultivation, processing and manufacturing facilities; (vi) statements in respect of operational efficiencies expected to be generated as a result of the Transaction in the amount of approximately C$100 million of pre-tax annual cost synergies; (vii) statements regarding the value and returns to shareholders expected to be generated by the business combination; (viii) expectations of future balance sheet strength and future equity; (ix) expectations regarding the Combined Company’s future M&A strategy; and (x) the expectation that the Combined Company’s shares will be listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange concurrently with, or as soon as possible after, the closing of the Transaction. Aphria and Tilray use words such as “forecast”, “future”, “should”, “could”, “enable”, “potential”, contemplate”, “believe”, “anticipate”, “estimate”, “plan”, “expect”, “intend”, “may”, “project”, “will”, “would” and the negative of these terms or similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. Certain material factors or assumptions were used in drawing the conclusions contained in the forward-looking statements throughout this communication, including the ability of the parties to receive, in a timely manner and on satisfactory terms, the necessary shareholder and court approvals for the Transaction, the ability of the parties to satisfy, in a timely manner, the conditions to closing of the Transaction and other expectations and assumptions concerning the Transaction. Forward-looking statements reflect current beliefs of management of Aphria and Tilray with respect to future events and are based on information currently available to each respective management team including the reasonable assumptions, estimates, analysis and opinions of management of Aphria and Tilray considering their experience, perception of trends, current conditions and expected developments as well as other factors that each respective management believes to be relevant as at the date such statements are made. Forward-looking statements involve significant known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause actual results, performance or achievement to be materially different from any future forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to, risks assumptions and expectations described in Aphria’s and Tilray’s critical accounting policies and estimates; the adoption and impact of certain accounting pronouncements; Aphria’s and Tilray’s future financial and operating performance; the competitive and business strategies of Aphria and Tilray; the intention to grow the business, operations and potential activities of Aphria and Tilray; the ability of Aphria and Tilray to complete the Transaction; Aphria’s and Tilray’s ability to provide a return on investment; Aphria’s and Tilray’s ability to maintain a strong financial position and manage costs, the ability of Aphria and Tilray to maximize the utilization of their existing assets and investments and that the completion of the Transaction is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions as set forth in the Arrangement Agreement. There can be no assurance as to when these conditions will be satisfied or waived, if at all, or that other events will not intervene to delay or result in the failure to complete the Transaction. There is a risk that some or all the expected benefits of the Transaction may fail to materialize or may not occur within the time periods anticipated by Aphria and Tilray. The challenge of coordinating previously independent businesses makes evaluating the business and future financial prospects of the Combined Company following the Transaction difficult. Material risks that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements also include the inherent uncertainty associated with the financial and other projections a well as market changes arising from governmental actions or market conditions in response to the COVID-19 public health crisis; the prompt and effective integration of the Combined Company; the ability to achieve the anticipated synergies and value-creation contemplated by the Transaction; the risk associated with Aphria’s and Tilray’s ability to obtain the approval of the proposed transaction by their shareholders required to consummate the Transaction and the timing of the closing of the Transaction, including the risk that the conditions to the Transaction are not satisfied on a timely basis or at all; the risk that a consent or authorization that may be required for the Transaction is not obtained or is obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated; the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against the parties and others related to the Arrangement Agreement; unanticipated difficulties or expenditures relating to the Transaction, the response of business partners and retention as a result of the announcement and pendency of the Transaction; risks relating to the value of Tilray’s common stock to be issued in connection with the transaction; the impact of competitive responses to the announcement of the Transaction; and the diversion of management time on transaction-related issues. Readers are cautioned that the foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive. Other risks and uncertainties not presently known to Aphria and Tilray or that Aphria and Tilray presently believe are not material could also cause actual results or events to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements contained herein. For a more detailed discussion of risks and other factors, see the most recently filed annual information form of Aphria and the annual report filed on form 10-K of Tilray made with applicable securities regulatory authorities and available on SEDAR and EDGAR. The forward-looking statements included in this communication are made as of the date of this communication and neither Aphria nor Tilray undertake any obligation to publicly update such forward-looking statements to reflect new information, subsequent events or otherwise unless required by applicable securities laws.

On October 10, 2018, Tilray, Inc. (“Tilray”) entered into an indenture relating to the issuance of $450 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the “notes”) (the “Indenture”) by and between Tilray and GLAS Trust Company LLC, as trustee (the “Trustee”). The notes will bear interest at a rate of 5.00% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on April 1, 2019. Additional interest may accrue on the notes in specified circumstances set forth in the Indenture, including upon Tilray’s failure to comply with certain reporting requirements. The notes will mature on October 1, 2023, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. The notes are convertible, at a holder’s election, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, into cash, shares of Tilray’s Class 2 common stock, par value $0.0001 (the “Common Stock”) or a combination of cash and shares of Tilray’s Common Stock, at Tilray’s election, at the applicable conversion rate (i) at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding April 1, 2023 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on March 31, 2019 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the Common Stock, for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price for the notes on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period (the “measurement period”) in which the trading price (as defined in the Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of the notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale of Common Stock and the conversion rate for the notes on each such trading day; (3) if Tilray calls the notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date and (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events as set forth in the Indenture or (ii) at any time on or after April 1, 2023 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediate preceding the maturity date, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. The initial conversion rate for the notes is 5.9735 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $167.41 per share of Common Stock), subject to adjustment as provided in the Indenture. The initial conversion rate represents a premium of approximately 15% to the $145.57 per share closing price of Common Stock on October 4, 2018. The conversion rate for the notes is subject to adjustment under certain circumstances in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date or if Tilray delivers a notice of redemption in respect of the notes, Tilray will, under certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate of the notes for a holder who elects to convert its notes in connection with such a corporate event or notice of redemption, as the case may be. Tilray may not redeem the notes prior to October 1, 2021. Tilray may redeem for cash all or any portion of the notes, at its option, on or after October 1, 2021 and on or before the 30th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, if the last reported sale price of the Common Stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price for the notes then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which Tilray provides a notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the relevant redemption date. No sinking fund is provided for the notes. If Tilray undergoes a fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture), holders may require Tilray to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding the fundamental change repurchase date. The Indenture includes customary covenants and sets forth certain events of default after which the notes may be declared immediately due and payable and set forth certain types of bankruptcy or insolvency events of default involving Tilray after which the notes become automatically due and payable. The following events are considered “events of default” under the Indenture: • default for 30 consecutive days in the payment when due of interest on the notes; • default in the payment of principal of any note when due and payable at its stated maturity, upon optional redemption, upon any required repurchase, upon declaration of acceleration or otherwise; • failure by Tilray to comply with its obligations to convert the notes in accordance with the Indenture upon exercise of a holder’s conversion right, and such failure continues for three business days; • failure by Tilray to give a fundamental change notice, notice of a make-whole fundamental change or notice of certain specified corporate events, and such failure continues for five business days; • failure by Tilray to comply with its obligations in respect of any consolidation, merger or sale of assets; • failure by Tilray to comply with any of the other agreements in the Indenture for 60 days after the receipt of written notice of such failure from the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of notes then outstanding; • default by Tilray or any significant subsidiary (as defined in the Indenture) of Tilray with respect to any mortgage, agreement or other instrument under which there may be outstanding, or by which there may be secured or evidenced, any indebtedness for money borrowed in excess of $20,000,000 (or its foreign currency equivalent) in the aggregate of Tilray and/or any such significant subsidiary, whether such indebtedness now exists or shall thereafter be created (i) resulting in such indebtedness becoming or being declared due and payable prior to its stated maturity date or (ii) constituting a failure to pay the principal of any such indebtedness when due and payable, at its stated maturity, upon required repurchase, upon declaration of acceleration or otherwise, and in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), such acceleration shall not have been rescinded or annulled or such failure to pay or default shall not have been cured or waived, or such indebtedness is not paid or discharged, as the case may be, within 30 days after written notice to Tilray by the Trustee or to Tilray and the Trustee by holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding; or • final judgment or judgments for the payment in excess of $20,000,000 (or its foreign currency equivalent) (excluding any amounts owed by insurance) in the aggregate rendered against Tilray or any significant subsidiary of Tilray, which judgment is not discharged, bonded, paid, waived or stayed within 60 days after (i) the date on which the right to appeal thereof has expired if no such appeal has commenced, or (ii) the date on which all rights to appeal have been extinguished; • certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of Tilray or any of Tilray’s significant subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indenture provides that, to the extent Tilray so elects, the sole remedy for an event of default relating to certain failures by Tilray to comply with certain reporting covenants in the Indenture will, for the first 365 days after such event of default, consist exclusively of the right to receive additional interest on the notes. The notes are Tilray’s general unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to all of Tilray’s indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the notes; equal in right of payment with any of Tilray’s unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of Tilray’s secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables but excluding intercompany obligations) of Tilray’s current or future subsidiaries. The Indenture provides that Tilray shall not consolidate with or merge with or into, or sell, convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of the consolidated properties and assets of Tilray to another person (other than any such sale, conveyance, transfer or lease to one or more of Tilray’s direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries), unless (i) the resulting, surviving or transferee person (if not Tilray) is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, and such corporation (if not Tilray) expressly assumes by supplemental indenture all of Tilray’s obligations under the notes and the Indenture and (ii) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture. The net proceeds from this offering were approximately $435.0 million, after deducting the initial purchasers’ commissions and other fees and estimated expenses payable by Tilray. Tilray intends to use the net proceeds to repay the approximately $9.1 million existing mortgage related to its facility in Nanaimo, British Columbia. Tilray intends to use the remainder of the net proceeds for working capital, future acquisitions and general corporate purchases. The summary of the foregoing transactions is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Indenture and the Form of 5.00% Convertible Senior Note due 2023, which are filed as Exhibit 4.1 and 4.2, respectively, hereto and are incorporated herein by reference.

The notes were also sold to accredited investors in Canada pursuant to an exemption from the prospectus requirements of Canadian securities laws. In addition, Tilray granted the Initial Purchasers a 13-day option to purchase up to an additional $67.5 million aggregate principal amount of notes on the same terms and conditions, solely to cover over-allotments. Tilray intends to use the net proceeds from the offering of the notes for working capital, future acquisitions and general corporate purposes, and to repay the approximately $9.1 million existing mortgage related to its facility in Nanaimo, British Columbia.

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. On January 14, 2019, Tilray, Inc. (the “ Company ”), a global pioneer in cannabis production and distribution, entered into a Profit Participation Agreement (the “ Profit Participation Agreement ”) and a Payment Agreement (the “ Payment Agreement ”) with ABG Intermediate Holdings 2, LLC (“ ABG ”), pursuant to which the Company purchased from ABG participation rights in up to 49% of the net (i.e., post-expense) royalties from cannabis products bearing brands currently within the ABG portfolio (ratably based on the portion of the aggregate amount of consideration (as described below) received by ABG) that ABG receives from the exploitation of certain ABG brands in connection with the development, marketing and sale of cannabis-related products. As consideration for such participation rights, the Company (a) paid $20,000,000 in cash to ABG and issued 840,107 shares of Class 2 Common Stock of the Company to ABG (valued at $66,666,666 in aggregate based on the “Opening Stock Value” described below), (b) has agreed to pay an additional $13,333,333 in cash to ABG not later than 45 days after the date of the Payment Agreement, (c) has agreed to pay an additional 840,107 shares of Class 2 Common Stock of the Company to ABG with an aggregate value of $66,666,667 based on the Opening Stock Value, subject to certain triggers pertaining to the regulatory status of cannabidiol in the United States, and (d) has agreed to pay further additional consideration with an aggregate value of $83,333,333 in a combination, at ABG’s election, of up to $16,666,667 in cash and the remainder of such value in shares of Class 2 Common Stock of the Company (based on a 15-trading day volume weighted average price of such shares on the date of payment of such further additional consideration) subject to certain triggers pertaining to the regulatory status of tetrahydrocannibinol in the United States or the receipt of $5,000,000 in distributions to the Company from the Profit Participation Agreement derived from cannabis products that contain tetrahydrocannibinol outside of the United States, in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in, the Payment Agreement. For the purposes of the transaction, the parties agreed that the Company’s Class 2 Common Stock “Opening Stock Value” is the average of the volume weighted average trading price of such shares for the two 15-trading day periods ended on January 10 and January 11, 2019. That average is $79.355 per Class 2 Common Stock of the Company. The shares of Class 2 Common Stock of the Company that were issued and are to be issued in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Profit Participation Agreement and the Payment Agreement have not been registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission and are subject to certain transfer restrictions. Under the Profit Participation Agreement, the Company will, among other things and in addition to the participation rights, have the opportunity to (a) license and develop cannabis products bearing brands currently within the ABG portfolio, and (b) supply active cannabinoid ingredients, including tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol, for products created and sold pursuant to licenses entered into by ABG with the Company or third parties to develop branded cannabis products. In the event ABG acquires additional brands after entering into the Profit Participation Agreement, the Company will also have the right to purchase participation rights in the net (i.e., post-expense) royalties from cannabis products bearing such brands, to be negotiated with ABG in each instance. The foregoing descriptions of the transactions contemplated by the Profit Participation Agreement and the Payment Agreement do not purport to be complete and are subject to, and are qualified in their entirety by, the full text of the Profit Participation Agreement and the Payment Agreement, which will be filed as exhibits to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.

On October 3, 2018, Tilray, Inc. (“Tilray”) announced that it intends to offer, subject to market conditions and other factors, $400 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the “notes”) in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) (the “Offering”). The notes will be sold to accredited investors in Canada pursuant to an exemption from the prospectus requirements of Canadian securities laws. A copy of this press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference. In connection with the Offering, the management of Tilray will provide information to, and conduct meetings with, members of the investment community. Such information contains certain estimated preliminary financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2018, and are provided below. The ranges presented below are based on the information available to Tilray at this time. Tilray has provided ranges, rather than specific amounts, because these results are preliminary. As such, Tilray’s actual results may vary materially from the estimated preliminary results presented here and will not be finalized until after the filing of this report. Tilray has not identified any unusual or unique events or trends that occurred during the period that it believes will materially affect these estimates. This data has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, Tilray’s management. Tilray’s independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte LLP, has not audited, reviewed, compiled, or performed any procedures with respect to the preliminary financial results. Accordingly, Deloitte LLP does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. Tilray’s revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2018 is expected to be between $10.0 million and $10.5 million, compared to $5.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017. In addition, as of September 30, 2018, Tilray’s cash and cash equivalents were between $117.5 million and $118.0 million, and our long-term debt (including current portion of long-term debt) was between $9.0 million and $9.5 million. Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements The preliminary financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2018 are forward-looking statements and may differ materially from actual results. These estimates should not be viewed as a substitute for Tilray’s full interim or annual financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on this preliminary data. These estimated preliminary results should be read in conjunction with Tilray’s consolidated financial statements and related notes as well as the sections captioned “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Tilray’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 and in Tilray’s prospectus related to the initial public offering of its Class 2 common stock filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) (Registration Statement No. 333-225741).

As previously disclosed on December 15, 2020, Tilray, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Tilray”), and Aphria Inc., a corporation existing under the laws of the Province of Ontario (“Aphria”), entered into an Arrangement Agreement, as amended on February 19, 2021 (the “Arrangement Agreement”), pursuant to which all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Aphria will be exchanged for Class 2 common stock of Tilray, in accordance with a specified exchange ratio, pursuant to a plan of arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (Ontario) (the “Arrangement”). On April 7, 2021, Tilray’s board of directors appointed, effective upon the closing of the Arrangement, David F. Clanachan to serve on the Tilray board of directors as a Class II Board member for the balance of the term expiring at Tilray’s 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (which is the Class II term) and until his successor has been duly elected and qualified, or until his earlier death, resignation or removal.

The forward-looking statements are expressly qualified by this cautionary statement. Forward-looking statements are provided for the purpose of presenting information about management’s current expectations and plans relating to the future, and readers are cautioned that such statements may not be appropriate for other purposes. Any information or statements that are contained in this Form 8-K that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements in this Form 8-K with regards to: (i) statements relating to the strategic business combination of Aphria and Tilray and the expected timing and closing of the Transaction; Transaction including, receipt of required shareholder approvals, court approvals and satisfaction of other closing customary conditions; (ii) estimates of pro-forma financial information of the combined company, including in respect of expected revenues and production of cannabis; (iii) the expected strategic and financial benefits of the business combination, including estimates of future cost reductions, synergies, including expected pre-tax synergies, savings and efficiencies; (iv) statements that the combined company anticipates having scalable medical and adult-use cannabis platforms expected to strengthen the leadership position in Canada, internationally and, eventually in the United States; (v) statements that the combined company is expected to offer a diversified and branded product offering and distribution footprint, state-of-the-art cultivation, processing and manufacturing facilities; (vi) statements in respect of operational efficiencies expected to be generated as a result of the Transaction in the amount of approximately C$100 million of pre-tax annual cost synergies; (vii) statements regarding the value and returns to shareholders expected to be generated by the business combination; (viii) expectations of future balance sheet strength and future equity; (ix) expectations regarding the combined company’s future M&A strategy; and (x) the expectation that the combined company’s shares will be listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange concurrently with, or as soon as possible after, the closing of the Transaction. Aphria and Tilray use words such as “forecast”, “future”, “should”, “could”, “enable”, “potential”, “contemplate”, “believe”, “anticipate”, “estimate”, “plan”, “expect”, “intend”, “may”, “project”, “will”, “would” and the negative of these terms or similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. Certain material factors or assumptions were used in drawing the conclusions contained in the forward-looking statements throughout this Form 8-K, including the ability of the parties to receive, in a timely manner and on satisfactory terms, the necessary shareholder and court approvals for the Transaction, the ability of the parties to satisfy, in a timely manner, the conditions to closing of the Transaction and other expectations and assumptions concerning the Transaction. Forward-looking statements reflect current beliefs of management of Aphria and Tilray with respect to future events and are based on information currently available to each respective management team including the reasonable assumptions, estimates, analysis and opinions of management of Aphria and Tilray considering their experience, perception of trends, current conditions and expected developments as well as other factors that each respective management believes to be relevant as at the date such statements are made. Forward-looking statements involve significant known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause actual results, performance or achievement to be materially different from any future forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to, risks assumptions and expectations described in Aphria’s and Tilray’s critical accounting policies and estimates; the adoption and impact of certain accounting pronouncements; Aphria’s and Tilray’s future financial and operating performance; the competitive and business strategies of Aphria and Tilray; the intention to grow the business, operations and potential activities of Aphria and Tilray; the ability of Aphria and Tilray to complete the Transaction; Aphria’s and Tilray’s ability to provide a return on investment; Aphria’s and Tilray’s ability to maintain a strong financial position and manage costs, the ability of Aphria and Tilray to maximize the utilization of their existing assets and investments and that the completion of the Transaction is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions as set forth in the Arrangement Agreement. There can be no assurance as to when these conditions will be satisfied or waived, if at all, or that other events will not intervene to delay or result in the failure to complete the Transaction. There is a risk that some or all the expected benefits of the Transaction may fail to materialize or may not occur within the time periods anticipated by Aphria and Tilray. The challenge of coordinating previously independent businesses makes evaluating the business and future financial prospects of the combined company following the Transaction difficult. Material risks that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements also include the inherent uncertainty associated with the financial and other projections a well as market changes arising from governmental actions or market conditions in response to the COVID-19 public health crisis; the prompt and effective integration of the combined company; the ability to achieve the anticipated synergies and value-creation contemplated by the Transaction; the risk associated with Aphria’s and Tilray’s ability to obtain the approval of the proposed transaction by their shareholders required to consummate the Transaction and the timing of the closing of the Transaction, including the risk that the conditions to the Transaction are not satisfied on a timely basis or at all; the risk that a consent or authorization that may be required for the Transaction is not obtained or is obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated; the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against the parties and others related to the Arrangement Agreement; unanticipated difficulties or expenditures relating to the Transaction, the response of business partners and retention as a result of the announcement and pendency of the Transaction; risks relating to the value of Tilray’s common stock to be issued in connection with the transaction; the impact of competitive responses to the announcement of the Transaction; and the diversion of management time on transaction-related issues. Readers are cautioned that the foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive. Other risks and uncertainties not presently known to Aphria and Tilray or that Aphria and Tilray presently believe are not material could also cause actual results or events to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements contained herein. For a more detailed discussion of risks and other factors, see the most recently filed annual information form of Aphria and the annual report filed on form 10-K of Tilray made with applicable securities regulatory authorities and available on SEDAR and EDGAR. The forward-looking statements included in this Form 8-K are made as of the date of this Form 8-K and neither Aphria nor Tilray undertake any obligation to publicly update such forward-looking statements to reflect new information, subsequent events or otherwise unless required by applicable securities laws. 2 SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

Approval of Settlement of Tilray Brands, Inc. Reorganization Litigation – Special Litigation Committee In February and March 2020, Tilray Brands, Inc. ("" Tilray "" or "" Company "") stockholders filed a class action and derivative complaint in the Delaware Court of Chancery asserting claims in connection with the merger in 2019 of Privateer Holdings, Inc. with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of Tilray (the "" Downstream Merger ""). Those claims were later consolidated and an amended consolidated complaint filed on July 17, 2020 asserted claims against Brendan Kennedy, Christian Groh, Michael Blue, and Privateer Evolution, LLC for alleged breaches of fiduciary duty in their alleged capacities as Tilray’s controlling stockholders and against Kennedy, Michael Auerbach, and Maryscott Greenwood for alleged breaches of fiduciary duty as directors and/or officers of Tilray in connection with the Downstream Merger. In July 2021, Tilray's Board of Directors established a Special Litigation Committee (the “ SLC ”) of independent directors to investigate the derivative claims. In July 2022, the SLC reached an agreement in principle with the Defendants and certain non-parties, and their respective insurers, to resolve the claims asserted in exchange for an aggregate amount of $26.9 million to be paid to Tilray plus mutual releases. The SLC subsequently reached a further agreement with an additional non-party and plaintiffs to settle the entire action for an aggregate amount equal to $39.9 million. On December 20, 2022, the parties submitted to the Delaware Court of Chancery a Stipulation and Agreement of Compromise, Settlement, and Release ("" Settlement Stipulation "") which provided for, among other things, an aggregate cash amount of $39.9 million to be paid to Tilray and mutual releases. The Settlement Stipulation was formally approved by the Delaware Court on March 7, 2023, and Tilray expects to receive the settlement proceeds within the following five (5) business days. Plaintiffs' counsel was awarded fees equal to $6.5 million. Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.

Emerging growth company ☐ If an emerging growth company, indicate by check mark if the registrant has elected not to use the extended transition period for complying with any new or revised financial accounting standards provided pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act. ☐ Item 3.03 Material Modification to Rights of Security Holders. On September 30, 2020, all outstanding shares of Class 1 common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, automatically converted into the same number of shares of Class 2 common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Certificate”) of Tilray, Inc. (the “Company”). No additional Class 1 shares will be issued following such conversion. The conversion occurred pursuant to Article IV, Section D.5 of the Certificate, which provided that each one share of Class 1 common stock would convert automatically, without any further action, into one share of Class 2 common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, at 5:00 p.m. in New York City, New York on the first trading day falling after the date on which, at all times on such date, the outstanding shares of Class 1 Common Stock represent less than ten percent (10%) of the aggregate number of shares of the then outstanding Class 1 common stock and Class 2 common stock. Also in accordance with Article IV, Section D.5 of the Certificate, and as required by Section 243 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, on October 1, 2020, the Company filed a certificate with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware effecting the retirement and cancellation of the shares of Class 1 common stock that were issued but not outstanding following the conversion (the “Certificate of Retirement”). Pursuant to Article IV, Section D.5(a) of the Certificate, effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Retirement, the obsolete references to Class 1 common stock in the Certificate were eliminated. The conversion had the following effects, among others, on the holders of shares of Class 1 common stock: Voting Power. Prior to the conversion, holders of shares of Class 1 common stock were entitled to cast ten votes per share on any matter submitted to a vote of the Company’s stockholders. As a result of the conversion, all holders of Class 2 common stock have only one vote per share on all matters subject to a stockholder vote. In addition, the provisions of the Certificate and Delaware law that entitled the holders of shares of Class 2 and Class 1 common stock, in certain circumstances, to separate class voting rights are no longer applicable as a result of the conversion. Economic Interests. The conversion had no impact on the economic interests of holders of shares of Class 1 common stock, including with regard to dividends, liquidation rights, treatment in connection with a change of control or merger transaction and redemption. Capitalization. The conversion had no impact on the total number of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of capital stock; the shares of Class 1 common stock converted into an equivalent number of shares of Class 2 common stock. However, the Company’s total number of authorized shares of capital stock was reduced from 760,000,000 to 743,333,333 to account for the elimination of the 16,666,667 shares of Class 1 common stock that were issued prior to the conversion. The Company’s authorized capital stock consists of 500,000,000 shares of Class 2 common stock, 233,333,333 shares of Class 1 common stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share. The Company’s Certificate prohibits the issuance of any shares of Class 1 common stock. Resale of Common Stock. Shares of Class 2 common stock may be sold in the same manner as such shares and shares of Class 1 common stock were previously sold prior to the conversion. The Company’s affiliates and holders of any shares that constitute restricted securities will continue to be subject to the restrictions specified in Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Item 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year. As described under Item 3.03, on October 1, 2020, the Company filed the Certificate of Retirement with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to retire and cancel the shares of Class 1 common stock that were issued but not outstanding following the conversion. Pursuant to Article IV, Section D.5(a) of the Certificate, effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Retirement, the obsolete references to Class 1 common stock in the Certificate were eliminated. The foregoing description of the Certificate of Retirement is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Certificate of Retirement, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 3.1 hereto, and the Certificate, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 3.2 hereto, which are incorporated by reference into this Item 5.03. 1 Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.

Item 8.01 Other Events. Lock-Up Release As previously announced, on December 12, 2019, Tilray completed its transaction with Privateer Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Privateer”), in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of September 9, 2019 (the “Merger Agreement”) by and among Tilray, Privateer, Down River Merger Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of Tilray and Michael Blue, as the Stockholder Representative. Pursuant to the terms described in the Merger Agreement, Privateer merged with and into Merger Sub (the “Merger”), with Merger Sub surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Tilray. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each Privateer equity holder who received shares of Tilray common stock in the Merger is subject to a lock-up (the “Lock-Up Agreement”) allowing for the sale of such shares only under certain circumstances over a two-year period. During the first year following the closing of the Merger, the Lock-Up Agreement provides that the subject shares are permitted to be sold pursuant to certain offerings, block trades or strategic sales approved or arranged by Tilray, at the discretion of its Board of Directors. At the end of the first year, the lock-up restrictions lapse with respect to 50% of the total shares subject to the Lock-Up Agreement (with permitted sales being credited towards and included in such 50%) will be released. Over the course of the second year following the closing of the Merger, the remaining shares will be subject to a staggered release in four equal quarterly increments. On May 29, 2020, the Board unanimously approved the pro rata release of 19.5 million shares of Class 1 and Class 2 common stock from the Lock-Up Agreement as a permitted sale (the “Waiver and Release”), waiving the release requirements included in the Lock-Up Agreement and treating the release of such shares as permitted sales. The Waiver and Release will take effect prior to trading on June 5, 2020, and the released shares may be sold on or after that date, subject to applicable securities law or contractual limitations. This Waiver and Release is in addition to the previously approved and announced pro rata release of 11 million shares of Class 2 common stock that was effective on April 3, 2020. The Waiver and Release will apply on a pro rata basis to each former Privateer equity holder who received shares of or options to purchase Tilray Class 1 and Class 2 common stock in the Merger, including certain of Tilray’s officers and directors. The Waiver and Release of these shares, together with the previously approved and released shares, represents approximately 40.2% of the originally locked-up shares (including for purposes of such percentage calculation shares that remain subject to escrow and/or subject to outstanding assumed stock options). 2 SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

Other Events. As previously disclosed on December 15, 2020, Tilray, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Tilray”), and Aphria Inc., a corporation existing under the laws of the Province of Ontario (“Aphria”), entered into an Arrangement Agreement, as amended on February 19, 2021, (the “Arrangement Agreement”), pursuant to which all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Aphria will be exchanged for Class 2 common stock of Tilray, in accordance with a specified exchange ratio, pursuant to a plan of arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (Ontario) (the “Arrangement”). On March 12, 2020, Tilray filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) a definitive joint proxy statement/circular (the “Proxy Statement/Circular”) with respect to the special meeting of Tilray stockholders held on April 16, 2021 and adjourned until April 30, 2021 pursuant to the Arrangement (the “Tilray Special Meeting”). Supplemental Disclosures to the Proxy Statement/Circular This Current Report on Form 8-K (this “Form 8-K”) is being filed to update and supplement the Proxy Statement/Circular.

The disclosure under the heading “QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE ARRANGEMENT AND THE MEETINGS” and subheading “General Questions and Answers” beginning on page 1 of the Proxy Statement/Circular is hereby amended and supplemented by replacing second question on page 8 in its entirety with the following: Q: What am I voting on? You are being asked to consider and vote on the following proposals: 1. To consider and vote on a proposal to increase the authorized capital stock of Tilray from 743,333,333 shares to 900,000,000 shares of capital stock, consisting of 890,000,000 shares of Class 2 common stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, as reflected in the amendment to the second amended and restated certificate of Tilray attached as Appendix “F” to the Circular (the “ Tilray Charter Amendment ”), which is further described in this Circular, including in the section entitled “Amendment to Tilray’s Organizational Documents” beginning on page 137 of this Circular and a copy of the Tilray Charter Amendment is attached as Appendix “F” (the “ Tilray Charter Amendment Proposal ”). 2. To consider and vote on a proposal to issue Tilray Class 2 common stock (the “ Tilray Shares ”) to Aphria Shareholders pursuant to the Arrangement Agreement which is further described in this Circular, including in the section entitled “The Arrangement Agreement and Related Agreements” beginning on page 115 of this Circular, and a copy of the Arrangement Agreement is attached as Appendix “A” (the “ Tilray Share Issuance Proposal ”); 3. To consider and approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation that may be paid to Tilray’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the transactions contemplated by the Arrangement Agreement, which is further described in this Circular, including in the section entitled “Interests of Tilray’s Directors and Management in the Arrangement” beginning on page 96 of this Circular (the “ Tilray Advisory Compensation Proposal ”); 4. To approve the adjournment of the Tilray Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies in the event there are not sufficient votes at the time of the Tilray Meeting to approve the Tilray Charter Amendment Proposal or the Tilray Share Issuance Proposal (the “ Tilray Adjournment Proposal ”). The Tilray Charter Amendment Proposal, the Tilray Share Issuance Proposal, the Tilray Advisory Compensation Proposal and the Tilray Adjournment Proposals are together referred to as the “ Tilray Proposals ”. Please note that the approval of Tilray Stockholders to each of the Tilray Charter Amendment Proposal and of the Tilray Share Issuance Proposal is required in order to complete the Arrangement. The disclosure under the heading “GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE TILRAY MEETING AND VOTING” and subheading “Quorum” beginning on page 41 of the Proxy Statement/Circular is hereby amended and supplemented by the last sentence on page 42 in its entirety with the following: Quorum The presence at the Tilray Meeting, by remote participation or represented by proxy, of the holders of a majority one-third of the voting power of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat as of the Tilray Record Date, will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the Tilray Meeting. The disclosure under the heading “DESCRIPTION OF THE ARRANGEMENT” and subheading “Background to the Arrangement” beginning on page 47 of the Proxy Statement/Circular is hereby amended and supplemented by adding the following language after the first full paragraph on page 57. In February 2021 the Tilray Board held meetings to consider, among other things, proposed amendments to the Arrangement Agreement. After discussions with Management and representatives from Cooley, Potter Anderson Cowen, and Blakes, on February 19, 2021, the Tilray Board approved an amendment to the Arrangement Agreement (the “Arrangement Agreement Amendment”). Later that day, Aphria and Tilray executed the Arrangement Agreement Amendment. On April 8, 2021, the Tilray Board held a meeting to discuss the upcoming Tilray Meeting scheduled for April 16, 2021. During this meeting, Mr. Kennedy and Ms. Redler, along with representatives from Cooley, Potter Anderson and MacKenzie, discussed the number of Tilray Stockholders who had submitted proxies in connection with the Tilray Meeting and whether a quorum for the Tilray Meeting would be attained. MacKenzie advised that, at the current pace of voting, it would be unlikely that the quorum requirement would be satisfied. Among other things, MacKenzie noted that the Tilray Meeting did not include any “routine” proposals, and thus uninstructed shares held by brokers would not count towards the quorum. MacKenzie reviewed the likely reasons for the difficulty in obtaining a quorum, including the large “dead block,” the number of retail stockholders, and the significant trading in the stock following the record date for the Tilray Meeting. The Tilray Board further discussed with MacKenzie the efforts to date to solicit additional proxies in connection with the Tilray Meeting. MacKenzie also reported that proxies received to date were running substantially in favor of the Tilray Proposals, with greater than 90% of responses being in favor of the Tilray Charter Amendment Proposal and the Tilray Share Issuance Proposal. On April 9 and April 11, 2021, the Tilray Board held meetings with Ms. Redler and representatives from Cooley and Potter Anderson to discuss, among other things, a potential adjournment of the Tilray Meeting and a potential amendment to the Current Tilray Bylaws to reduce the quorum requirement for stockholder meetings from stockholders representing a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares entitled to vote to the statutory minimum of one-third of the voting power of the outstanding shares entitled to vote (the “Quorum Amendment”). The Tilray Board also discussed the possibility of a waiver by both Tilray and Aphria of the Charter Amendment Proposal as a condition precedent to the Arrangement, in the event such proposal is not approved by the Tilray Stockholders at the Tilray Meeting (the “Charter Amendment Proposal Waiver”). At each meeting, the Tilray Board also received an update on the proxy solicitation from MacKenzie and MacKenzie’s view as to the likelihood of whether a quorum of stockholders would be achieved at the Tilray Meeting with and without the Quorum Amendment. In addition, the Tilray Board discussed the possibility of renegotiating to improve certain economic terms of the Arrangement to potentially encourage Tilray Stockholders who were still able to vote to do so. Between April 9 and April 15, 2021, representatives of Tilray and representatives of Aphria discussed, among other things, a potential adjournment of the Tilray Meeting, the Quorum Amendment, the Charter Amendment Proposal Waiver, and a potential adjustment to the exchange ratio set forth in the Arrangement Agreement. During these discussions, the representatives of Aphria expressed an unwillingness to renegotiate the economic terms of the Arrangement. On April 13, 2021, the Tilray Board held a meeting to discuss a potential adjournment of the Tilray Meeting, the Quorum Amendment and the Charter Amendment Proposal Waiver, with Ms. Redler and representatives from Cooley, Potter Anderson, and Cowen. At the meeting, Cowen presented certain updated financial and market information to the Tilray Board. Messrs. Kruteck and Levin also joined the meeting, and along with Mr. Kennedy, provided management’s recommendation and continued support for the Arrangement. The Tilray Board discussed the presentations from Cowen and Messrs. Kennedy, Kruteck and Levin, including management’s assessment of the potential challenges that Tilray would face if the Arrangement was not consummated. In addition, the Tilray Board reviewed with its advisors the efforts required by Tilray under the Arrangement Agreement in connection with obtaining the required Tilray Stockholder approvals. The Tilray Board determined that the failure to satisfy the quorum requirement and obtain the requisite Tilray Stockholder approval at the Tilray Meeting would result in the loss of a transaction that was in the best interests of the Tilray Stockholders. On April 14, 2021, the Tilray Board approved the adjournment of the Tilray Meeting from April 16, 2021 to April 30, 2021 by unanimous written consent. Also on April 14, 2021, Aphria’s shareholders approved the Arrangement at the Aphria Meeting. On April 15, 2021, the Tilray Board met with Ms. Redler and representatives from Cooley, Potter Anderson, Lowenstein, and Imperial to discuss, among other things, the Arrangement, the Quorum Amendment and the Charter Amendment Proposal Waiver. At this meeting, Imperial presented certain publicly available financial and market information to the Tilray Board. Following that, the Tilray Board, along with the representatives from Cooley and Potter Anderson, considered possible alternatives to the Quorum Amendment, including maintaining the status quo. In light of the alternatives available, and taking into account the updated financial and market information presented to the Board, and management’s continued support for the transaction, the Tilray Board determined that the Quorum Amendment and the Charter Amendment Proposal Waiver were necessary in order to facilitate a transaction that was in the best interests of Tilray and the Tilray Stockholders. On April 15, 2021, the Tilray Board approved the Quorum Amendment and the Charter Amendment Proposal Waiver, and Aphria and Tilray signed a waiver consenting to and acknowledging the Quorum Amendment and the Charter Amendment Proposal Waiver. The disclosure in Appendix “J” “COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF APHRIA SHAREHOLDERS AND TILRAY STOCKHOLDERS” under the column “Tilray Stockholder Rights (Post-Arrangement)” and row “Shareholder Quorum” beginning on page J-1 of the Proxy Statement/Circular is hereby amended and supplemented by the last paragraph under the row “Shareholder Quorum” on page J‑9 in its entirety with the following: The Current Tilray Bylaws provide that the presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority one-third of the voting power of the outstanding shares entitled to vote will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business.

Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements Certain information in this email constitutes forward-looking information or forward-looking statements (together, “forward-looking statements”) under Canadian securities laws and within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created by such sections and other applicable laws. The forward-looking statements are expressly qualified by this cautionary statement. Forward-looking statements are provided for the purpose of presenting information about management’s current expectations and plans relating to the future, and readers are cautioned that such statements may not be appropriate for other purposes. Any information or statements that are contained in this email that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements in this email with regards to: (i) statements relating to the strategic business combination of Aphria and Tilray and the expected timing and closing of the Transaction; Transaction including, receipt of required shareholder approvals, court approvals and satisfaction of other closing customary conditions; (ii) estimates of pro-forma financial information of the Combined Company, including in respect of expected revenues and production of cannabis; (iii) the expected strategic and financial benefits of the business combination, including estimates of future cost reductions, synergies, including expected pre-tax synergies, savings and efficiencies; (iv) statements that the Combined Company anticipates having scalable medical and adult-use cannabis platforms expected to strengthen the leadership position in Canada, internationally and, eventually in the United States; (v) statements that the Combined Company is expected to offer a diversified and branded product offering and distribution footprint, state-of-the-art cultivation, processing and manufacturing facilities; (vi) statements in respect of operational efficiencies expected to be generated as a result of the Transaction in the amount of approximately C$100 million of pre-tax annual cost synergies; (vii) statements regarding the value and returns to shareholders expected to be generated by the business combination; (viii) expectations of future balance sheet strength and future equity; (ix) expectations regarding the Combined Company’s future M&A strategy; and (x) the expectation that the Combined Company’s shares will be listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange concurrently with, or as soon as possible after, the closing of the Transaction. Aphria and Tilray use words such as “forecast”, “future”, “should”, “could”, “enable”, “potential”, “contemplate”, “believe”, “anticipate”, “estimate”, “plan”, “expect”, “intend”, “may”, “project”, “will”, “would” and the negative of these terms or similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. Certain material factors or assumptions were used in drawing the conclusions contained in the forward-looking statements throughout this email, including the ability of the parties to receive, in a timely manner and on satisfactory terms, the necessary shareholder and court approvals for the Transaction, the ability of the parties to satisfy, in a timely manner, the conditions to closing of the Transaction and other expectations and assumptions concerning the Transaction. Forward-looking statements reflect current beliefs of management of Aphria and Tilray with respect to future events and are based on information currently available to each respective management team including the reasonable assumptions, estimates, analysis and opinions of management of Aphria and Tilray considering their experience, perception of trends, current conditions and expected developments as well as other factors that each respective management believes to be relevant as at the date such statements are made. Forward-looking statements involve significant known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause actual results, performance or achievement to be materially different from any future forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to, risks assumptions and expectations described in Aphria’s and Tilray’s critical accounting policies and estimates; the adoption and impact of certain accounting pronouncements; Aphria’s and Tilray’s future financial and operating performance; the competitive and business strategies of Aphria and Tilray; the intention to grow the business, operations and potential activities of Aphria and Tilray; the ability of Aphria and Tilray to complete the Transaction; Aphria’s and Tilray’s ability to provide a return on investment; Aphria’s and Tilray’s ability to maintain a strong financial position and manage costs, the ability of Aphria and Tilray to maximize the utilization of their existing assets and investments and that the completion of the Transaction is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions as set forth in the Arrangement Agreement. There can be no assurance as to when these conditions will be satisfied or waived, if at all, or that other events will not intervene to delay or result in the failure to complete the Transaction. There is a risk that some or all the expected benefits of the Transaction may fail to materialize or may not occur within the time periods anticipated by Aphria and Tilray. The challenge of coordinating previously independent businesses makes evaluating the business and future financial prospects of the Combined Company following the Transaction difficult. Material risks that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements also include the inherent uncertainty associated with the financial and other projections a well as market changes arising from governmental actions or market conditions in response to the COVID-19 public health crisis; the prompt and effective integration of the Combined Company; the ability to achieve the anticipated synergies and value-creation contemplated by the Transaction; the risk associated with Aphria’s and Tilray’s ability to obtain the approval of the proposed transaction by their shareholders required to consummate the Transaction and the timing of the closing of the Transaction, including the risk that the conditions to the Transaction are not satisfied on a timely basis or at all; the risk that a consent or authorization that may be required for the Transaction is not obtained or is obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated; the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against the parties and others related to the Arrangement Agreement; unanticipated difficulties or expenditures relating to the Transaction, the response of business partners and retention as a result of the announcement and pendency of the Transaction; risks relating to the value of Tilray’s common stock to be issued in connection with the transaction; the impact of competitive responses to the announcement of the Transaction; and the diversion of management time on transaction-related issues. Readers are cautioned that the foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive. Other risks and uncertainties not presently known to Aphria and Tilray or that Aphria and Tilray presently believe are not material could also cause actual results or events to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements contained herein. For a more detailed discussion of risks and other factors, see the most recently filed annual information form of Aphria and the annual report filed on form 10-K of Tilray made with applicable securities regulatory authorities and available on SEDAR and EDGAR. The forward-looking statements included in this email are made as of the date of this email and neither Aphria nor Tilray undertake any obligation to publicly update such forward-looking statements to reflect new information, subsequent events or otherwise unless required by applicable securities laws.

The press release is filed as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference. CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain information in this communication constitutes forward-looking information or forward-looking statements (together, “forward-looking statements”) under Canadian securities laws and within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created by such sections and other applicable laws. The forward-looking statements are expressly qualified by this cautionary statement. Forward-looking statements are provided for the purpose of presenting information about management’s current expectations and plans relating to the future, and readers are cautioned that such statements may not be appropriate for other purposes. Any information or statements that are contained in this communication that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward- looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements in this communication with regards to: (i) statements relating to the strategic business combination of Aphria and Tilray and the expected timing and closing of the proposed business combination (the “Transaction”); Transaction including, receipt of required shareholder approvals, court approvals and satisfaction of other closing customary conditions; (ii) estimates of pro-forma financial information of the Combined Company, including in respect of expected revenues and production of cannabis; (iii) the expected strategic and financial benefits of the business combination, including estimates of future cost reductions, synergies, including expected pre-tax synergies, savings and efficiencies; (iv) statements that the Combined Company anticipates having scalable medical and adult-use cannabis platforms expected to strengthen the leadership position in Canada, internationally and, eventually in the United States; (v) statements that the Combined Company is expected to offer a diversified and branded product offering and distribution footprint, state-of-the-art cultivation, processing and manufacturing facilities; (vi) statements in respect of operational efficiencies expected to be generated as a result of the Transaction in the amount of approximately C$100 million of pre-tax annual cost synergies; (vii) statements regarding the value and returns to shareholders expected to be generated by the business combination; (viii) expectations of future balance sheet strength and future equity; (ix) expectations regarding the Combined Company’s future M&A strategy; and (x) the expectation that the Combined Company’s shares will be listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange concurrently with, or as soon as possible after, the closing of the Transaction. Aphria and Tilray use words such as “forecast”, “future”, “should”, “could”, “enable”, “potential”, contemplate”, “believe”, “anticipate”, “estimate”, “plan”, “expect”, “intend”, “may”, “project”, “will”, “would” and the negative of these terms or similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. Certain material factors or assumptions were used in drawing the conclusions contained in the forward-looking statements throughout this communication, including the ability of the parties to receive, in a timely manner and on satisfactory terms, the necessary shareholder and court approvals for the Transaction, the ability of the parties to satisfy, in a timely manner, the conditions to closing of the Transaction and other expectations and assumptions concerning the Transaction. Forward-looking statements reflect current beliefs of management of Aphria and Tilray with respect to future events and are based on information currently available to each respective management team including the reasonable assumptions, estimates, analysis and opinions of management of Aphria and Tilray considering their experience, perception of trends, current conditions and expected developments as well as other factors that each respective management believes to be relevant as at the date such statements are made. Forward-looking statements involve significant known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause actual results, performance or achievement to be materially different from any future forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to, risks assumptions and expectations described in Aphria’s and Tilray’s critical accounting policies and estimates; the adoption and impact of certain accounting pronouncements; Aphria’s and Tilray’s future financial and operating performance; the competitive and business strategies of Aphria and Tilray; the intention to grow the business, operations and potential activities of Aphria and Tilray; the ability of Aphria and Tilray to complete the Transaction; Aphria’s and Tilray’s ability to provide a return on investment; Aphria’s and Tilray’s ability to maintain a strong financial position and manage costs, the ability of Aphria and Tilray to maximize the utilization of their existing assets and investments and that the completion of the Transaction is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions as set forth in the Arrangement Agreement. There can be no assurance as to when these conditions will be satisfied or waived, if at all, or that other events will not intervene to delay or result in the failure to complete the Transaction. There is a risk that some or all the expected benefits of the Transaction may fail to materialize or may not occur within the time periods anticipated by Aphria and Tilray. The challenge of coordinating previously independent businesses makes evaluating the business and future financial prospects of the Combined Company following the Transaction difficult. Material risks that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements also include the inherent uncertainty associated with the financial and other projections a well as market changes arising from governmental actions or market conditions in response to the COVID-19 public health crisis; the prompt and effective integration of the Combined Company; the ability to achieve the anticipated synergies and value-creation contemplated by the Transaction; the risk associated with Aphria’s and Tilray’s ability to obtain the approval of the proposed transaction by their shareholders required to consummate the Transaction and the timing of the closing of the Transaction, including the risk that the conditions to the Transaction are not satisfied on a timely basis or at all; the risk that a consent or authorization that may be required for the Transaction is not obtained or is obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated; the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against the parties and others related to the Arrangement Agreement; unanticipated difficulties or expenditures relating to the Transaction, the response of business partners and retention as a result of the announcement and pendency of the Transaction; risks relating to the value of Tilray’s common stock to be issued in connection with the transaction; the impact of competitive responses to the announcement of the Transaction; and the diversion of management time on transaction-related issues. Readers are cautioned that the foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive. Other risks and uncertainties not presently known to Aphria and Tilray or that Aphria and Tilray presently believe are not material could also cause actual results or events to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements contained herein. For a more detailed discussion of risks and other factors, see the most recently filed annual information form of Aphria and the annual report filed on form 10-K of Tilray made with applicable securities regulatory authorities and available on SEDAR and EDGAR. The forward-looking statements included in this communication are made as of the date of this communication and neither Aphria nor Tilray undertake any obligation to publicly update such forward-looking statements to reflect new information, subsequent events or otherwise unless required by applicable securities laws.

The Letter Agreement provides that Mr. Patel’s starting annualized base salary will be $200,000 and that he will also be eligible to earn a total of $3,400,000 in sign-on bonuses, to be paid in bi-weekly installments over 24 months, subject to his continuous employment with the Company through the payment date of the applicable installment. Mr. Patel is also entitled to reimbursement of substantiated relocation expenses up to $200,000 in connection with his relocation to the Dallas/Fort Worth area. The Letter Agreement also provides that, on the first business day of the first calendar quarter that commences after the effective date of his employment (the “Grant Date”), Mr. Patel will be entitled to a grant of a number of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) of the Company’s Class A common stock (the “Common Stock”) determined by dividing $14,000,000 by the average closing price of the Common Stock for the 30 trading days immediately preceding the Grant Date (the “Initial Equity Award”). The Initial Equity Award will vest as follows: 10% on the first anniversary of the Grant Date, 20% on the second anniversary of the Grant Date, and 23.333% on each of the third, fourth, and fifth anniversaries of the Grant Date, subject in each case to Mr. Patel’s continuous service to the Company through the applicable vesting date. As inducement to accept the offer of employment and to buyout certain equity entitlements and other compensation Mr. Patel is forfeiting from his current employer, Mr. Patel will also be entitled to a grant of a number of RSUs determined by dividing $21,000,000 by the average closing pricing of the Common Stock for the 30 trading days immediately preceding the Grant Date (the “Buyout Equity Award”). The Buyout Equity Award will vest one-third on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the Grant Date, subject in each case to Mr. Patel’s continuous service to the Company through the applicable vesting date. Finally, the Letter Agreement provides that Mr. Patel’s employment is conditioned on his execution of a restrictive covenant agreement that includes covenants regarding non-competition, non-solicitation and confidentiality. Under the Letter Agreement, if Mr. Patel’s employment is terminated by the Company without Cause (as defined in the Letter Agreement), he will be entitled to receive the following severance benefits: (i) an amount equal to six months of his base salary, (ii) an amount equal to six months of COBRA premiums for Mr. Patel and his eligible dependents, (iii) any sign-on bonus installments which then remain unpaid and (iv) the vesting of that portion of the Initial Equity Award and Make-Whole Equity Award, if any, that was otherwise scheduled to vest in the ordinary course during the six month period immediately following his termination date. Mr. Patel’s eligibility for these severance benefits is subject to his execution of a release of claims against the Company and his compliance with any applicable post-employment covenants. The foregoing description of the Letter Agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Letter Agreement, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference. There are no other arrangements or understandings between Mr. Patel and any other persons pursuant to which Mr. Patel was named Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Patel does not have any family relationship with any of the Company’s directors or executive officers or any persons nominated or chosen by the Company to be a director or executive officer.

Equity Purchase Agreement On November 21, 2018, GameStop Corp. (the “ Company ”) entered into an Equity Purchase Agreement (the “ Purchase Agreement ”) with Prime Communications, L.P. (“ Parent ”), Prime Acquisition Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (“ Purchaser ”), Spring Communications Parent, Inc. (“ HoldCo ”) and Spring Communications Holding, Inc. (“ Spring ”), pursuant to which Purchaser agreed to purchase and the Company agreed to sell all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Spring (the “ Sale ”), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement. The Sale was approved by the Company’s Board of Directors, and is expected to close in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. The Purchase Agreement is attached hereto and incorporated herein as Exhibit 2.1. The Purchase Agreement provides for a cash purchase price of $700 million, (i) plus the amount of any cash held by Spring at closing, (ii) plus or minus the amount by which Spring’s non-cash working capital at closing is greater or less than $141,390,927, (iii) minus any indebtedness of Spring at closing and (iv) minus any unpaid transaction expenses. The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, covenants and indemnification provisions. Subject to a few specified exceptions, the representations and warranties will not survive the closing of the Sale and Parent and Purchaser’s sole recourse shall be the representation and warranties insurance policy. The representation and warranties insurance policy is subject to certain policy limits, exclusions, deductibles and other terms and conditions. The Company has agreed to customary non-compete and non-solicitation provisions contained in the Purchase Agreement. The Company’s obligation to close the Sale is subject to, among other things, (i) the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (“ HSR ”), (ii) the absence of any law or order from a governmental body prohibiting the consummation of the Sale, (iii) the performance of certain covenants and (iv) the accuracy of each of Parent and Purchaser’s representations as of the closing, in all material respects. Parent’s obligation to close the Sale is subject to, among other things, (i) the expiration or termination of the waiting period under HSR, (ii) the absence of any law or order from a governmental body prohibiting the consummation of the Sale, (iii) the performance of certain covenants, (iv) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company and Spring as of the Closing, subject to specified materiality standards and (v) the absence of a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Purchase Agreement). The Purchase Agreement may be terminated by mutual written consent of the Company and Parent or by either the Company or Parent in the following circumstances: uncured breach of representation, warranty or covenant by the other party; failure to complete the closing of the Sale on or prior to March 21, 2019; failure of Parent to obtain debt financing; or action by a governmental body prohibiting the consummation of the Sale. Parent may terminate the Purchase Agreement in the event a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) occurs between signing and closing. The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in the Purchase Agreement have been made only for the purposes of the Purchase Agreement and solely for the benefit of the parties to the Purchase Agreement, may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties, may have been made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the Purchase Agreement instead of establishing these matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Accordingly, the Purchase Agreement is included with this filing only to provide investors with information regarding the terms of the Purchase Agreement, and not to provide investors with any other factual information regarding the parties or their respective businesses, and should be read in conjunction with the disclosures in the Company’s periodic reports and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In connection with signing the Purchase Agreement, Parent has obtained a debt financing commitment for the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, the aggregate proceeds of which will be used by Parent, together with other resources of Parent, to pay the cash purchase price at closing. SunTrust Bank, Compass Bank dba BBVA Compass, U.S. Bank National Association and Zions Bancorporation, N.A. (dba Amegy Bank) (the “Lenders”) have committed to provide $810 million of senior secured credit facilities subject to the conditions set forth in a commitment letter dated as of November 21, 2018 (the “Debt Commitment Letter”). The obligations of the Lenders to provide debt financing under the Debt Commitment Letter are subject to a number of conditions. Parent must pay a reverse termination fee of $25 million if the Purchase Agreement is terminated solely due to non-receipt by Parent of its debt financing. At closing, the parties are expected to enter into transition services agreements to support the transition of services between the parties in connection with the separation of the Spring business from the Company and transfer to Parent. The foregoing description of the Purchase Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Purchase Agreement which is attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference as Exhibit 2.1. Item 8.01 Other Events. On November 21, 2018, the Company issued a press release announcing the signing of the Purchase Agreement.

(the “Company”), our Chief Executive Officer and our other active named executive officers (as listed in the preliminary proxy statement filed with the SEC on April 13, 2020) have elected to temporarily reduce their 2020 base salaries by 50%, and 30%, respectively. In addition, our Board of Directors has elected to temporarily reduce its annual cash compensation by 50%. Both of these adjustments are effective April 26, 2020, and continue until June 30, 2020, or such earlier date as determined by the Compensation Committee. Due to the temporary nature of this change, other employee benefit or compensation arrangements that are determined as a function of base salary (such as life insurance, annual bonus targets or severance amounts) will not be altered and will continue to be based on the original salary level. On April 20, 2020, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved these changes in active named executive officer compensation. Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure. Effective April 26, 2020, in addition to base salary reductions for our Chief Executive Officer and other active named executive officers and the reduction to the Board of Directors cash retainer fees described above under Item 5.02(e), we have reduced pay for certain other employees by graduated amounts between 10% and 30%. In addition, we have offered certain corporate and other support team members the option to work under either half-time/half-pay structure or a temporary furlough program. As of April 21, 2020, the Company provided the following updates to its global operations: Store Operations: • Approximately one-third of U.S. stores locations remain closed, with two-thirds of U.S. stores closed to customers but available for curbside pick-up. • We have begun the process of re-opening certain stores in Italy, Germany, Austria and the states of South Carolina and Georgia and continue to monitor our ability to re-open stores in our other operating countries and states in the coming weeks. • All stores in Australia have remained open for business with strong results, reflecting an increase of approximately 24% in comparable store sales for the nine weeks ended April 4, 2020, the final day of the fiscal March period. Sales Update: The Company’s comparable store sales for the nine weeks ended April 4, 2020, declined approximately 23% on a year-over-year basis, which includes the impact of the majority of stores having closed in most operating countries throughout the fiscal month of March. • For the three-week period ended March 21, 2020, the date the Company closed U.S stores to the public, comparable U.S. store sales grew approximately 3% as the company experienced a surge in demand across products that people need to work, learn or play from home. • For the five-week fiscal March period, the Company’s Australian stores posted comparable store sales increase of approximately 64%. Liquidity: As of April 4, 2020, the Company had approximately $772 million in total cash and liquidity (approximately $706 million in cash and $66 million in availability on its revolver). The Company continues to expect it has sufficient liquidity and financial flexibility to navigate the current environment. Due to the impact of pandemic-related governmental regulations and certain landlord decisions to close properties, we are in discussions with our landlords regarding ongoing rent obligations, including potential abatement, deferral and or restructuring of future rent obligations payable during this period of COVID-19 related closure.

On April 18, 2021, GameStop Corp. (the “Company”) and George E. Sherman, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, entered into a Transition and Separation Agreement (the “Transition Agreement”). The Transition Agreement provides for Mr. Sherman to step down as the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer on the earliest of (i) July 31, 2021, (ii) the effective date of the Company’s appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer or (iii) the date his employment with the Company ceases due to his death, disability or termination by the Company without cause (such earliest date, the “Separation Date”). Subject to his continued employment with the Company through the Separation Date and his continued compliance with his confidentiality, non-compete, non-solicitation and other protective covenants included in his employment agreement with the Company, Mr. Sherman will become entitled to accelerated vesting of all of his then outstanding time-vested shares of restricted stock upon his execution of, and the irrevocability of, a general release promptly following the Separation Date. This accelerated vesting of time-vested restricted stock is one of the severance rights provided in Mr. Sherman’s employment agreement with the Company. Mr. Sherman has voluntarily agreed to the elimination of all other severance rights provided in his employment agreement and has also agreed to cancel his 2020 performance-vested restricted stock award, which consisted of 308,477 shares of common stock (but which could have resulted in the delivery of a number of shares equal to 0% to 200% of that amount, depending on actual performance). Subject to Mr. Sherman’s reelection at the Company’s 2021 annual meeting of stockholders, he has agreed to continue to serve as a director of the Company. Mr. Sherman has declined to receive compensation for his service as a director, both before and after the Separation Date. As disclosed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2021 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 23, 2021 (the “Form 10-K”), the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) has been evaluating the Company’s executive leadership to ensure the Company has the right skills to meet changing business requirements. The Form 10-K also noted that the Board has retained a third-party firm to support its efforts. The Board’s Strategic Planning and Capital Allocation Committee is leading a search to identify new Chief Executive Officer candidates with the capabilities and experience to help accelerate the next phase of the Company’s transformation.

On May 8, 2019, GameStop Corp. (“GameStop”) and Daniel J. Kaufman entered into an amendment (the “Amendment”) of his Executive Employment Agreement with GameStop dated October 1, 2012, as amended on March 1, 2018 and May 31, 2018 (the “Employment Agreement”). The Amendment reflects the change in Mr. Kaufman’s position from Chief Legal and Administrative Officer and Corporate Secretary to Chief Transformation Officer (CTO), effective May 10, 2019, as well as the following additional changes to the Employment Agreement: (i) Upon a termination without cause, resignation with good reason or disability termination, performance-based equity awarded during or after 2019 would remain outstanding and vest, if at all, based on actual performance through the end of the applicable performance period (rather than immediately vesting at target, as the Employment Agreement previously provided with respect to all performance-based equity awards and continues to provide with respect to pre-2019 performance-based equity awards); (ii) Upon a termination without cause or resignation with good reason during the 2020 fiscal year, in addition to his other severance rights, Mr. Kaufman would be eligible to receive a pro-rata annual bonus for the year of termination, based on actual performance in that year; and (iii) Any severance benefits payable to Mr. Kaufman under the Employment Agreement will be conditioned on his execution of a general release of claims in a form reasonably prescribed by GameStop. The CTO position is a challenging role that GameStop believes will be central to a successful transformation of its business. Given his executive skills, experience and deep familiarity with our organization, GameStop concluded that Mr. Kaufman is uniquely qualified to fill this role and lead the transformation process. The CTO position will require Mr. Kaufman’s full time and attention and, therefore, he was asked to step down from his former roles of Chief Legal and Administrative Officer and Corporate Secretary and his former duties were reassigned to other GameStop employees. However, the CTO position is a not a permanent role. Upon conclusion of the transformation process, it is not expected that Mr. Kaufman will have the opportunity to resume his former duties or be offered another senior executive position with GameStop. Therefore, in consideration for Mr. Kaufman’s agreement to accept the CTO position and waive his right to resign now with “good reason” as a result of the reassignment of his former duties, the Amendment provides that, if Mr. Kaufman remains in service through June 1, 2020 (the expected end date for the CTO position), a resignation from employment by Mr. Kaufman during June 2020 will be treated under the Employment Agreement as a resignation with good reason. Upon a good reason resignation, Mr. Kaufman would be entitled to the severance benefits contemplated by his Employment Agreement, as amended. The foregoing description of the Amendment is qualified by reference to the full text of the Amendment, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1. Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.

No assurance can be given that future results expressed or implied by the forward looking statements will be achieved, and actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward looking statements. Such statements are based on management’s current expectations and beliefs and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward looking statements, many of which are beyond our control, and are not guarantees of future results or achievements. Consequently, no forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and there can be no assurance that the actual results or developments anticipated by such forward looking statements will be realized or, even if substantially realized, that they will have the expected consequences to, or effects on, the Company or its businesses or operations. As a result, you should not place undue reliance on any such statements and caution must be exercised in relying on forward looking statements. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in these forward looking statements: the uncertain impact, effects and results of the board’s review of operating, strategic, financial and structural alternative; volatility in capital and credit markets, including changes that reduce availability, and increase costs, of capital and credit; our inability to obtain sufficient quantities of product to meet consumer demand; the timing of release and consumer demand for new and pre-owned products; our ability to continue to expand, and successfully open and operate new stores for our collectibles business; risks associated with achievement of anticipated financial and operating results from acquisitions; our ability to sustain and grow our console digital video game sales; the impact of goodwill and intangible asset impairments; cost reduction initiatives, including store closing costs; risks related to changes in, and our continued retention of, executive officers and other key personnel; changes in consumer preferences and economic conditions; increased operating costs, including wages; cyber security events and related costs; risks associated with international operations; increased competition and changing technology in the video game industry; changes in domestic or foreign laws and regulations that reduce consumer demand for, or increase prices of, our products or otherwise adversely affect our business; our effective tax rate and the factors affecting our effective tax rate, including changes in international, federal or state tax, trade and other laws and regulations; the costs and outcomes of legal proceedings and tax audits; our use of proceeds from the sale of our Spring Mobile business; and unexpected changes in the assumptions underlying our outlook for fiscal 2019. Additional factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those reflected or described in the forward looking statements can be found in GameStop's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2019 filed with the SEC and available at the SEC's Internet site at http://www.sec.gov or http://investor.GameStop.com. Forward-looking statements contained in this press release speak only as of the date of this release. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by any applicable securities laws.

At-the-Market Offering Program On June 9, 2021, the Company filed a prospectus supplement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) in connection with the Company’s “at-the-market” offering program (the “ATM Offering”) for the offer and sale from time to time through Jefferies LLC (the “Sales Agent”) of up to 5,000,000 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Common Shares”), pursuant to the Company’s existing Open Market Sale Agreement SM (the “Sale Agreement”) with the Sales Agent dated December 8, 2020. Prior to the date hereof, an aggregate of 3,500,000 Common Shares were sold under the Sales Agreement for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $556,691,221. The Common Shares are being offered and sold pursuant to the Company’s automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (the “Shelf Registration Statement”) filed with the SEC on December 8, 2020, which became effective immediately upon filing. From time to time during the term of the Sale Agreement, the Company may deliver a placement notice to the Sales Agent specifying the length of the selling period, the amount of Common Shares to be sold, any limitation on the number of shares that may be sold in any one trading day and the minimum price below which sales may not be made. Upon its acceptance of the placement notice from the Company, the Sales Agent will use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its normal trading and sales practices to solicit offers to purchase Common Shares, under the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Sale Agreement, by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”), in negotiated transactions or in transactions that are deemed to be an “at the market offering” as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) under the Securities, in block transactions, sales made directly on the Principal Market or sales made into any other existing trading markets of the Common Shares. The Company may instruct the Sales Agent not to sell Common Shares if the sales cannot be effected at or above the price designated by the Company in any placement notice. The Company or the Sales Agent may suspend the ATM Offering at any time upon proper notice and subject to other conditions. The Company will pay the Sales Agent a commission for its services in acting as agent in the sale of Common Shares. The Sales Agent will be entitled to compensation in an amount up to 1.5 percent (1.5%) of the gross sales price of all of the Common Shares sold through it under the Sale Agreement. Under the terms of the Sale Agreement, the Company also may sell Common Shares to the Sales Agent, as principal for its own account, at a price to be agreed upon at the time of sale. If the Company sells Common Shares to the Sales Agent, as principal, it will enter into a separate sales agreement with the Sales Agent and the Company will describe such agreement in a separate prospectus supplement or pricing supplement. The ATM Offering will terminate upon the earlier of (1) the sale of all Common Shares subject to the Sale Agreement or (2) termination of the Sale Agreement. The Sale Agreement may be terminated by the Sales Agent or the Company at any time upon ten days’ notice, and by the Sales Agent at any time in certain circumstances, including suspension of trading of Common Shares on the NYSE or the occurrence of a material adverse change in the Company’s business. The Company made certain customary representations, warranties and covenants concerning the Company and the Common Shares in the Sale Agreement and also agreed to indemnify the Sales Agent against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Troutman Pepper Hamilton Sanders LLP, counsel to the Company, has issued a legal opinion relating to the legality of the issuance and the sale of the Common Shares. A copy of such legal opinion, including the consent included therein, is attached as Exhibit 5.1 hereto. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the ATM Offering, if any, for general corporate purposes as well as for investing in growth initiatives and maintaining a strong balance sheet. The Sale Agreement was filed as Exhibit 1.1 to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December 8, 2020 and is incorporated herein by reference. The description of the material terms of the Sale Agreement is qualified in its entirely by reference to such Exhibit.

The Common Shares are being offered and sold pursuant to the Company’s automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (the “Shelf Registration Statement”) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on December 8, 2020, which became effective immediately upon filing. A prospectus supplement relating to the Offering has been filed today with the SEC. From time to time during the term of the Sale Agreement, the Company may deliver a placement notice to the Sales Agent specifying the length of the selling period, the amount of Common Shares to be sold, any limitation on the number of shares that may be sold in any one trading day and the minimum price below which sales may not be made. Upon its acceptance of the placement notice from the Company, the Sales Agent will use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its normal trading and sales practices to solicit offers to purchase Common Shares, under the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Sale Agreement, by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”), in negotiated transactions or in transactions that are deemed to be an “at the market offering” as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), in block transactions, sales made directly on the Principal Market or sales made into any other existing trading markets of the Common Shares. The Company may instruct the Sales Agent not to sell Common Shares if the sales cannot be effected at or above the price designated by the Company in any placement notice. The Company or the Sales Agent may suspend the offering of the Common Shares at any time upon proper notice and subject to other conditions. The Company will pay the Sales Agent a commission for its services in acting as agent in the sale of Common Shares. The Sales Agent will be entitled to compensation in an amount up to three percent (3.0%) of the gross sales price of all of the Common Shares sold through it under the Sale Agreement. Under the terms of the Sale Agreement, the Company also may sell Common Shares to the Sales Agent, as principal for its own account, at a price to be agreed upon at the time of sale. If the Company sells Common Shares to the Sales Agent, as principal, it will enter into a separate sales agreement with the Sales Agent and the Company will describe such agreement in a separate prospectus supplement or pricing supplement. The Offering of Common Shares pursuant to the Sale Agreement will terminate upon the earlier of (1) the sale of all Common Shares subject to the Sale Agreement or (2) termination of the Sale Agreement. The Sale Agreement may be terminated by the Sales Agent or the Company at any time upon ten days’ notice, and by the Sales Agent at any time in certain circumstances, including suspension of trading of Common Shares on the NYSE or the occurrence of a material adverse change in the Company’s business. The Company made certain customary representations, warranties and covenants concerning the Company and the Common Shares in the Sale Agreement and also agreed to indemnify the Sales Agent against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Troutman Pepper Hamilton Sanders LLP, counsel to the Company, has issued a legal opinion relating to the legality of the issuance and the sale of the Common Shares. A copy of such legal opinion, including the consent included therein, is attached as Exhibit 5.1 hereto.

On April 5, 2021, GameStop Corp., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), issued the press release, a copy of which is furnished with this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1, announcing its preliminary sales results. On April 5, 2021, the Company also issued the press release, a copy of which is furnished with this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.2, announcing the increase in the maximum aggregate offering price of shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Common Shares”), that may be sold in connection with the ATM Offering (as defined below). The information furnished herewith pursuant to this Item 7.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K shall not be deemed to be “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, and shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing. Item 8.01 Other Events. Preliminary Sales Results On April 5, 2021, the Company announced the following preliminary unaudited sales results: • For the nine-weeks ended April 3, 2021, total global sales increased approximately 11% from the nine-week period ended April 4, 2020; • For the five-week period ended April 2, 2021, total global sales increased approximately 18% from the five-week period ended April 4, 2020; and • For the four-week period ended February 27, 2021, total global sales increased approximately 5.3% from the four-week period ended February 29, 2020. During the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and due to the spread of COVID-19 around the world, the Company’s various operations across 14 countries were negatively impacted due to temporary store closures and other government mandated restrictions that resulted in limited operations. During the first nine weeks of fiscal 2021, similar government mandated restrictions resulted in limited operations, primarily in Europe, and the Company operated with an approximately 13% decrease in the store base due to its strategic store optimization efforts. The Company’s sales results are preliminary and subject to completion of the Company’s month-end and quarter-end closing process and adjustments. As the Company has not completed its month-end and first quarter fiscal 2021 close process, the preliminary sales results may change. The preliminary sales results have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, the Company’s management. The preliminary sales results have not been compiled or examined by the Company’s independent auditors nor have the Company’s independent auditors performed any procedures with respect to the preliminary sales results or expressed any opinion or any form of assurance on such results. In addition, the preliminary sales results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be achieved for the quarter ending May 1, 2021 or for any future period. At-the-Market Offering Program On April 5, 2021, the Company increased the maximum aggregate offering price of Common Shares that may be sold from time to time, through Jefferies LLC (the “Sales Agent”) in connection with the Company’s “at-the-market” offering program (the “ATM Offering”) to up to $1,000,000,000, but in no event more than 3,500,000 Common Shares, pursuant to the Company’s existing Open Market Sale Agreement SM (the “Sale Agreement”) with the Sales Agent dated December 8, 2020. Prior to the date hereof, no Common Shares were sold under the Sales Agreement. The Common Shares are being offered and sold pursuant to the Company’s automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (the “Shelf Registration Statement”) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on December 8, 2020, which became effective immediately upon filing. A prospectus supplement relating to the ATM Offering has been filed today with the SEC. From time to time during the term of the Sale Agreement, the Company may deliver a placement notice to the Sales Agent specifying the length of the selling period, the amount of Common Shares to be sold, any limitation on the number of shares that may be sold in any one trading day and the minimum price below which sales may not be made. Upon its acceptance of the placement notice from the Company, the Sales Agent will use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its normal trading and sales practices to solicit offers to purchase Common Shares, under the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Sale Agreement, by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”), in negotiated transactions or in transactions that are deemed to be an “at the market offering” as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) under the Securities, in block transactions, sales made directly on the Principal Market or sales made into any other existing trading markets of the Common Shares. The Company may instruct the Sales Agent not to sell Common Shares if the sales cannot be effected at or above the price designated by the Company in any placement notice. The Company or the Sales Agent may suspend the ATM Offering at any time upon proper notice and subject to other conditions. The Company will pay the Sales Agent a commission for its services in acting as agent in the sale of Common Shares. The Sales Agent will be entitled to compensation in an amount up to 1.5 percent (1.5%) of the gross sales price of all of the Common Shares sold through it under the Sale Agreement. Under the terms of the Sale Agreement, the Company also may sell Common Shares to the Sales Agent, as principal for its own account, at a price to be agreed upon at the time of sale. If the Company sells Common Shares to the Sales Agent, as principal, it will enter into a separate sales agreement with the Sales Agent and the Company will describe such agreement in a separate prospectus supplement or pricing supplement. The ATM Offering will terminate upon the earlier of (1) the sale of all Common Shares subject to the Sale Agreement or (2) termination of the Sale Agreement. The Sale Agreement may be terminated by the Sales Agent or the Company at any time upon ten days’ notice, and by the Sales Agent at any time in certain circumstances, including suspension of trading of Common Shares on the NYSE or the occurrence of a material adverse change in the Company’s business. The Company made certain customary representations, warranties and covenants concerning the Company and the Common Shares in the Sale Agreement and also agreed to indemnify the Sales Agent against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Troutman Pepper Hamilton Sanders LLP, counsel to the Company, has issued a legal opinion relating to the legality of the issuance and the sale of the Common Shares. A copy of such legal opinion, including the consent included therein, is attached as Exhibit 5.1 hereto. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the ATM Offering, if any, for working capital and general corporate purposes and to further strengthen its balance sheet, which may include funding its transformation initiatives and product category expansion efforts, the repayment, refinancing, redemption or repurchase of its existing indebtedness, capital expenditures or the satisfaction of its tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of shares of restricted stock held by its executive officers and other employees. The Sale Agreement was filed as Exhibit 1.1 to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December 8, 2020 and is incorporated herein by reference. The description of the material terms of the Sale Agreement is qualified in its entirely by reference to such Exhibit.

On January 10, 2021, GameStop Corp. (the “Company”) entered into an agreement (the “Agreement”) with RC Ventures LLC and Ryan Cohen (together, “RC Ventures”). Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company has agreed to increase the size of its board of directors (the “Board”) by three directors to a total of 13 directors and appoint Alain (Alan) Attal, Ryan Cohen and James (Jim) Grube (the “New Directors”) as members of the Board, each with a term expiring at the Company’s 2021 annual meeting of stockholders (the “2021 Annual Meeting”). The Company has further agreed that, effective at the 2021 Annual Meeting, the size of the Board will be reduced by four directors to a total of nine directors. The Board will nominate each of the New Directors (or their replacements appointed in accordance with the terms of the Agreement) and current directors Paul Evans, Reginald Fils-Aimé, George Sherman, William Simon, Carrie Teffner and Kurt Wolf for election as directors at the 2021 Annual Meeting. As part of the Agreement, RC Ventures has agreed to customary standstill provisions, which provide that from the date of the Agreement until the earlier of (a) the date that is 30 calendar days prior to the deadline for the submission of director nominations by stockholders for the Company’s 2022 annual meeting of stockholders and (b) the date that is 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the 2021 Annual Meeting (such period, the “Standstill Period”), RC Ventures will not, among other things: (i) acquire beneficial ownership in, or aggregate economic exposure to, directly or indirectly, more than 19.9% of the Company’s outstanding common stock; (ii) make any proposal for consideration by stockholders at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Company; (iii) make any offer or proposal with respect to any extraordinary transactions; or (iv) seek, alone or in concert with others, the appointment, election or removal of any directors in opposition to any recommendation of the Board, in each case as further described in the Agreement. As part of the Agreement, the Company has permitted RC Ventures to acquire, whether in a single transaction or multiple transactions from time to time, additional shares of the Company’s common stock to the extent such acquisitions would result in RC Ventures having beneficial ownership of less than 20.0% of the outstanding shares, without triggering the restrictions that would otherwise be imposed under Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”), and RC Ventures has agreed that upon acquiring beneficial ownership 20.0% or more of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock, the restrictions under Section 203 of the DGCL would apply to a potential business combination with RC Ventures as an “interested stockholder” (as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL). RC Ventures has also agreed that, during the Standstill Period, it will, and will cause its affiliates and associates to, vote its shares of the Company’s common stock at any meeting of the Company’s stockholders in favor of each director nominated and recommended by the Board for election at any such meeting and, subject to certain exceptions, in support of other proposals as recommended by the Board. Pursuant to the Agreement, the New Directors will receive the same benefits and the same compensation as other non-management directors on the Board, provided, that Mr. Cohen has waived his right to compensation for his service as a director of the Company. A copy of the Agreement is filed with this Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated by reference herein. The foregoing description of the Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Agreement. Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers. Pursuant to the Agreement, effective as of January 10, 2021, the Board (a) voted to increase the size of the Board to 13 directors, creating a total of three vacancies, and (b) appointed Alain (Alan) Attal, Ryan Cohen and James (Jim) Grube to fill the resulting vacancies, with terms expiring at the 2021 Annual Meeting. In addition, Mr. Attal was appointed to the Compensation Committee of the Board, Mr. Cohen was appointed to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board and Mr. Grube was appointed to the Audit Committee of the Board, each effective as of January 10, 2021. Other than as described in Item 1.01 of this Form 8-K and the Agreement, there are no arrangements or understandings between any of the New Directors or any other persons pursuant to which any of the New Directors were named a director of the Company. None of the New Directors or their immediate family members have any direct or indirect material interest in any transaction or proposed transaction required to be reported under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K. Item 1.01 of this Form 8-K is incorporated by reference herein. Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.

Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement. New Notes Indenture On July 6, 2020, GameStop Corp. (the “Company”), in connection with the settlement of its previously announced offer to exchange (the “Exchange Offer”) any and all of its outstanding $414.6 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75% Senior Notes due 2021 (the “Existing Notes”) for newly issued 10.00% Senior Secured Notes due 2023 (the “New Notes”), issued approximately $216.4 million aggregate principal amount of New Notes pursuant to an indenture, dated as of July 6, 2020 (the “New Notes Indenture”), among the Company, the subsidiary guarantors named therein, and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”) and as collateral agent (the “Collateral Agent”). The New Notes will bear interest at a rate of 10.00% per annum, payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2020. The New Notes will mature on March 15, 2023. The New Notes will be redeemable at the Company’s option, in whole or in part, at any time, or from time to time, prior to March 15, 2022 at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the New Notes, plus a “make-whole premium,” together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of redemption. On or after March 15, 2022, the New Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the New Notes redeemed to, but not including, the applicable redemption date. In addition, at any time on or prior to March 15, 2022, the Company may, subject to certain limitations specified in the New Notes Indenture, at its option and on one or more occasions, redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the New Notes at a redemption price equal to 110.00% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings. If the Company or its restricted subsidiaries sell assets, under certain circumstances, the Company will be required to use the net proceeds to make an offer to repurchase New Notes at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of the New Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the repurchase date. Upon a Change of Control (as defined in the New Notes Indenture), the Company must offer to purchase the New Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of such purchase. The Company’s obligations under the New Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis by each of the Company’s existing and future domestic subsidiaries that guarantee certain of the Company’s indebtedness or indebtedness of guarantors, including under the Company’s ABL Credit Agreement (as defined in the New Notes Indenture). The New Notes and the related guarantees are secured by first-priority liens on the Notes Priority Collateral (as defined in the New Notes Indenture) (which generally includes most of the Company’s and the guarantors’ assets other than the Excluded Property and ABL Priority Collateral (each as defined in the New Notes Indenture)) and by second-priority liens on the ABL Priority Collateral (which generally includes most of the Company’s and the guarantors’ credit card receivables, accounts receivable, payment intangibles, inventory, pledged deposit accounts and related assets), in each case, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens. The New Notes Indenture contains covenants that restrict the ability of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to: incur, assume or permit to exist additional indebtedness or guaranty obligations; declare or pay dividends or redeem or repurchase capital stock; prepay, redeem or purchase certain subordinated indebtedness; issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities; make loans and certain investments; sell assets; incur liens; engage in transactions with affiliates; enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends; and engage in mergers, acquisitions and other business combinations. Under the New Notes Indenture, if the New Notes are assigned investment grade ratings and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing, certain of these covenants will be suspended. The New Notes Indenture also contains certain affirmative covenants and events of default. The New Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended or the securities laws of any state and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. Fifth Supplemental Indenture As previously announced, on June 17, 2020, the Company entered into a fifth supplemental indenture (the “Fifth Supplemental Indenture”) to the indenture governing its Existing Notes that gives effect to certain proposed amendments (the “Proposed Amendments”) to such indenture. The Proposed Amendments became effective as of the settlement of the Exchange Offer on July 6, 2020. Intercreditor Agreement On July 6, 2020, the Company, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto, Bank of America, N.A., as ABL Agent (the “ABL Agent”), and U.S. Bank National Association, as Notes Collateral Agent (the “Notes Collateral Agent”), entered into the Intercreditor Agreement, to govern the relative priorities of Bank of America, N.A. as ABL Agent, and U.S. Bank National Association, as Notes Collateral Agent, respective security interests in the ABL Priority Collateral (as defined in the Indenture) and the Notes Priority Collateral (as defined in the Indenture) and certain other matters related to the administration of security interests in the Collateral (as defined in the Indenture). Pledge and Security Agreement Only July 6, 2020, the Company, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto and the Notes Collateral Agent entered into the Pledge and Security Agreement pursuant to which the Company and the subsidiary guarantors granted a security interest in favor of the Notes Collateral Agent in substantially all of their respective assets (subject to certain exceptions).

On March 21, 2019, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of GameStop Corp. (the “Company”) appointed George Sherman, age 56, to be its Chief Executive Officer, commencing on or about April 15, 2019 (the “Start Date”) and succeeding our interim Chief Executive Officer Shane Kim. Effective on the Start Date, the Board also expanded its size to ten members and appointed Mr. Sherman to serve as a member of the Board until our 2019 annual meeting of stockholders and until his successor is elected and qualified. Prior to his appointment as the Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Sherman served as the Chief Executive Officer of Victra, one of the largest authorized retailers for Verizon Wireless in the U.S. with more than 1,140 Verizon branded retail stores in 46 states. Mr. Sherman, who has a long background in the retail industry, had previously served three years as president of Advance Auto Parts based out of its operations center in Raleigh, North Carolina, including a short stint as interim CEO. During his tenure, he helped merge and integrate Raleigh-based General Parts International following its acquisition in 2014. Mr. Sherman has also served in leadership roles at Best Buy and Home Depot. In connection with his appointment as Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Sherman entered into an employment agreement with the Company dated March 21, 2019 (the “Employment Agreement”). The Employment Agreement provides that we will use commercially reasonable efforts to nominate him for re-election to the Board upon any expiration of his term of Board service that occurs during his employment. Accordingly, we intend to nominate Mr. Sherman for re-election to our Board at our 2019 annual meeting of stockholders. Mr. Sherman will be entitled to receive the following compensation and benefits in connection with his service to the Company: • an annual base salary of $1,100,000; • a one-time sign-on bonus of $150,000 (subject to repayment in the event of certain terminations within two years of his Start Date); • an annual cash bonus opportunity with a target amount equal to 150% of his base salary; • one-time relocation benefits in connection with his relocation to the Dallas/Ft. Worth metropolitan area; and • participation in the benefit plans and programs afforded other management personnel or as determined by the Board or its Compensation Committee. In addition, pursuant to New York Stock Exchange Rule 303A.08 and to induce Mr. Sherman to accept employment with the Company, Mr. Sherman will receive a “make whole” equity award with a grant date fair value of $6,000,000 and a 2019 annual equity award with a grant date fair value of $4,500,000. Each of these awards will consist of 50% time-vested restricted stock and 50% performance-based restricted stock. The vesting provisions of these awards will be substantially the same as those applicable to the 2019 annual equity awards that are expected to be made to our other named executive officers (three-year service requirement for time-vested awards; goals for the performance-based awards to be determined later in 2019; accelerated vesting in certain death, disability or severance scenarios). These awards will be made outside of GameStop’s Amended and Restated 2011 Incentive Plan, but will be subject to substantially the same terms as awards made under that plan. The Employment Agreement also provides for severance benefits if Mr. Sherman’s employment is terminated by the Company without cause or due to his resignation with good reason. In those cases, Mr. Sherman will be entitled to receive (i) a lump sum severance payment equal to two times the sum of his base salary and target annual bonus, and (ii) 18-months of Company paid COBRA benefits. In addition, his time-vested equity awards would then vest and his performance-vested equity awards would remain outstanding and vest, if at all, based on actual performance through the end of the applicable performance period. However, if the severance event occurs within 18 months following a Change in Control, the “two times” multiplier described in clause (i) above will be increased to “three times.” In each case, the severance benefits would be conditioned on Mr. Sherman’s execution of a release of claims. The Employment Agreement also includes customary non-solicitation, non-compete, intellectual property and confidentiality provisions. There are no other arrangements or understandings between Mr. Sherman and any other persons pursuant to which Mr. Sherman was named Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Mr. Sherman does not have any family relationship with any of the Company’s directors or executive officers or any persons nominated or chosen by the Company to be a director or executive officer. Other than with respect to the equity awards described in this Current Report, Mr. Sherman does not beneficially own any shares of the Company’s common stock. Mr. Sherman does not have any direct or indirect material interest in any transaction or proposed transaction required to be reported under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K. The foregoing description of the Employment Agreement is not complete and is qualified by reference to the full text of the Employment Agreement, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1. On March 20, 2019, Mr. Kim advised the Company that he will not stand for re-election to the Board at the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders. Mr. Kim’s decision to not stand for re-election is not because of a disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company’s operations, policies or practices.

The foregoing summary of this Letter Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Letter Agreement, which is attached to this Current Report as Exhibit 10.1 and which is incorporated by reference into this Item 5.02. Amendment to Employment Agreements On May 31, 2018, in connection with the appointment of Mr. Lloyd, the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to the additional position of Chief Operating Officer, the Company and Mr. Lloyd entered into a letter agreement that amends Mr. Lloyd’s Executive Employment Agreement. The amendment: (i) reflects Mr. Lloyd’s additional position as Chief Operating Officer of the Company, (ii) enumerates certain key duties and responsibilities associated with Mr. Lloyd’s positions with the Company, and (iii) provides for an increase in Mr. Lloyd’s base annual salary to $900,000. On May 31, 2018, in recognition of the additional responsibilities assumed by Daniel J. Kaufman, the Company’s Executive Vice President, Chief Legal and Administrative Officer, and Corporate Secretary, the Company and Mr. Kaufman entered into a letter agreement that amends Mr. Kaufman’s Executive Employment Agreement. The amendment: (i) enumerates certain key duties and responsibilities associated with Mr. Kaufman’s positions with the Company and (ii) provides for an increase in Mr. Kaufman’s base annual salary to $750,000. On May 31, 2018, in recognition of the additional responsibilities assumed by Troy W. Crawford, the Company’s Senior Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer, the Company and Mr. Crawford entered into a letter agreement that amends Mr. Crawford’s Executive Employment Agreement. The amendment provides for an increase in Mr. Crawford’s base annual salary to $500,000. On May 31, 2018, in recognition of the importance of the continued engagement and expected increase in the time commitment of Daniel A. DeMatteo to Company matters in his role as Executive Chairman, the Company and Mr. DeMatteo entered into a letter agreement that amends Mr. DeMatteo’s Executive Employment Agreement. The amendment provides for an increase in Mr. DeMatteo’s base annual salary to $500,000. The amendments to the Executive Employment Agreements for Messrs. Lloyd, Kaufman, Crawford and DeMatteo provide that their target annual bonus opportunities for 2018 will be equal to the weighted average between their prior target bonus opportunities (determined before these compensation changes) and new target bonus opportunities (determined after these changes). The foregoing summaries of the letter agreements with each of Messrs. Lloyd, Kaufman, Crawford and DeMatteo are qualified in their entirety by reference to the letter agreements themselves, which are attached to this Current Report as Exhibits 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, and 10.5, and which are incorporated by reference into this Item 5.02. Additional Equity Awards On May 31, 2018, the Compensation Committee authorized the grant of a restricted stock award under the Plan to each of Messrs. Lloyd and DeMatteo, with a grant-date fair value of $541,648 and $170,330, respectively, representing the incremental value of the increase in each executive’s 2018 target annual equity award, pro-rated from the period following the effective date of the increase through the end of fiscal 2018. These awards are intended to compensate the executives for the change in the scope of their roles and to also ensure that their total compensation for 2018 and beyond retains an appropriate balance between cash and equity elements, as well as short- and long-term elements. These awards will be subject to the same vesting criteria and other terms of the annual long-term incentive awards made to Messrs. Lloyd and DeMatteo on February 23, 2018 (50% time-vested and 50% performance-vested), except that these additional awards will not be subject to accelerated vesting under the Company’s Retirement Policy. The grant of these awards (as well as the award to Mr. Kim described above) will be effective on June 4, 2018, and therefore the number of shares subject to these awards or any portions thereof will be determined based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on that date. Adoption of Retention Program On May 31, 2018, the independent directors of the Board approved a cash retention program to encourage the retention of key employees of the Company. Recipients of retention awards will become entitled to payment of 50% of their award amounts on each of May 31, 2019 and May 31, 2020, provided in each case they remain in service through that date. Generally, an award will vest on an accelerated basis if the employee is terminated without cause before the otherwise applicable payment date (provided he or she executes a release). Messrs. Lloyd, Kaufman and Crawford participate in the retention program; their award amounts are $2,000,000, $2,000,000 and $1,000,000, respectively. These executives’ awards will vest on an accelerated basis upon a termination without cause or resignation with good reason (in each case, as defined in the applicable Executive Employment Agreement) prior to the otherwise applicable payment date, provided the executive executes a release. The foregoing summaries of the retention agreements with Messrs. Lloyd, Kaufman and Crawford are qualified in their entirety by reference to the retention agreements themselves, which are attached to this Current Report as Exhibits 10.6, 10.7 and 10.8 and which are incorporated by reference into this Item 5.02.

GameStop Corp. (the “Company”), as part of its on-going business transformation, announced several senior leadership changes on May 30, 2019 as summarized in this Item 5.02 and in Item 8.01 below. On May 30, 2019, Robert A. Lloyd resigned from the positions of Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, effective June 3, 2019. Mr. Lloyd will remain in service with the Company as a Senior Adviser until July 3, 2019 to support the transition of his duties to his successor and other Company employees. At the end of that transition period, Mr. Lloyd will resign from employment with the Company and be entitled to the payments, rights and benefits associated with a “good reason” resignation under his existing employment and retention agreements. Mr. Lloyd’s resignation did not result from a disagreement with the Company or any of its officers or other directors on any matter relating to the operations, policies or practices of the Company. The Company has previously filed copies of Mr. Lloyd’s employment agreement, as amended, and retention agreement as exhibits to Current Reports on Form 8-K, as reflected in the list of exhibits included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities Exchange Commission on April 2, 2019. The Company also announced that James A. Bell, age 51, will succeed Mr. Lloyd as the Company’s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, effective June 3, 2019. Between October 2016 and March 2019, Mr. Bell served as chief financial officer of Wok Holdings, Inc., a privately-held company headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona that owned and operated over 500 P.F. Chang’s, Pei Wei and True Food Kitchen restaurants worldwide. Between October 2014 and April 2016, Mr. Bell served as executive vice president and chief financial officer of Red Lion Hotels Corporation, a NYSE-listed hospitality and leisure company. Mr. Bell joined Red Lion from Coldwater Creek, Inc., formerly a multi-channel specialty retailer of women's apparel, jewelry and accessories headquartered in Sandpoint, Idaho, where he served as interim chief executive officer in March 2014, and where he also served as executive vice president, chief operating officer and chief financial officer from January 2012 to June 2014, senior vice president and chief financial officer from March 2010 to January 2012 and vice president of finance from September 2009 to March 2010. Prior to joining Coldwater Creek, Mr. Bell held various executive finance positions within the retail industry and served as a lieutenant in the United States Navy between 1989 and 1998. In connection with Mr. Bell’s hiring, he and the Company entered into an Executive Employment Agreement on May 30, 2019. That agreement, among other things, provides for the following: • an annual base salary of $700,000; • a one-time signing bonus of $50,000 (subject to repayment in the event of certain terminations within two years); • an annual cash bonus opportunity with a target amount equal to 100% of base salary; • one-time relocation benefits in connection with his relocation to the Dallas/Ft. Worth metropolitan area; and • participation in the benefit plans and programs afforded other management personnel or as determined by the Board or its Compensation Committee. In addition, pursuant to New York Stock Exchange Rule 303A.08 and to induce Mr. Bell to accept employment with the Company, he will receive an equity award with an intended value at grant of $1,300,000. The award will be issued on July 1, 2019 and consist of 50% time-vested restricted stock and 50% performance-based restricted stock. The vesting provisions of this award will be substantially the same as those applicable to the 2019 annual equity awards that have been made to our other named executive officers (three-year service requirement for time-vested awards; goals for the performance-based awards to be determined later in 2019; accelerated vesting in certain death, disability and severance scenarios). Mr. Bell’s agreement also provides for the following severance benefits if his employment is terminated by the Company without cause or if he resigns with good reason: (i) a lump sum severance payment equal to two times the sum of his base salary and target annual bonus, and (ii) 18-months of Company paid COBRA benefits. In addition, in those cases his time-vested equity awards would then vest and his performance-vested equity awards would remain outstanding and vest, if at all, based on actual performance through the end of the applicable performance period. However, if the severance event occurs within 18 months following a change in control, the “two times” multiplier described in clause (i) above will be increased to “two and one-half times.” In each case, the severance benefits would be conditioned on the executive’s execution of a release of claims. The agreement also includes customary non-solicitation, non-compete, intellectual property and confidentiality provisions. There are no other arrangements or understandings between Mr. Bell and any other persons pursuant to which Mr. Bell was named Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Bell does not have any family relationship with any of the Company’s directors or executive officers or any persons nominated or chosen by the Company to be a director or executive officer. Other than with respect to the equity award described in this Current Report, Mr. Bell does not beneficially own any shares of the Company’s common stock nor does he have any direct or indirect interest in any transaction or proposed transaction required to be reported under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K. The foregoing description of the Executive Employment Agreement between the Company and Mr. Bell is not complete and is qualified by reference to the full text of the agreement, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1. Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.

Item 8.01 Other Events. The Company announced on May 30, 2019 that it has hired Chris R. Homeister, age 50, as its Executive Vice President and Chief Merchandising Officer, effective June 10, 2019.

In connection with this hire, the Company and Mr. Homeister entered into an Executive Employment Agreement dated May 30, 2019.

On August 17, 2022, the Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Apple Inc. (“Apple”) approved the Apple Inc. Executive Cash Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) under which eligible participants may be granted cash incentive awards based on the achievement of performance goals over performance periods established by the Committee (each, an “Award”). The Plan is intended to attract, retain, motivate, reward and align the efforts of Plan participants with the objectives of Apple shareholders. Eligible participants are members of Apple’s executive team, including Apple’s named executive officers and other employees designated by the Committee. The Plan is administered by the Committee. The Committee establishes performance periods, which generally correlate to Apple’s fiscal years, and performance goals for which achievement will be measured over each performance period. The Committee also establishes any applicable threshold, target and maximum level of achievement for each performance goal. The Committee will specify the performance period, performance goal(s), maximum payout opportunity and any other terms and conditions for the Awards. The payout that a participant may receive under the Plan with respect to an Award is based upon whether and to what extent the performance goals have been achieved, as determined by the Committee after receiving the necessary information to evaluate such achievement after the end of the performance period. The payout will be made in cash as soon as practicable after the Committee considers the achievement of the performance goals, and to the extent applicable, a participant’s performance. If a participant terminates service prior to a payout date, the participant’s Award will be forfeited unless otherwise determined by the Committee.

Apple’s shareholders approved the 2022 Plan at the Company’s Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on March 4, 2022 (the “Annual Meeting”). Apple’s grant authority under the Apple Inc. 2014 Employee Stock Plan (the “2014 Plan”) will terminate after the 2022 Plan is registered on Form S-8. The 2022 Plan, which became effective upon shareholder approval, permits the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock grants and restricted stock units. Employees and consultants of Apple and its subsidiaries are eligible to participate in the 2022 Plan. The maximum number of shares that may be issued or transferred pursuant to awards under the 2022 Plan will equal: • 510 million shares, plus • the number of shares available for new award grants under the 2014 Plan on the date of the Annual Meeting, plus • the number of any shares subject to stock options granted under the 2014 Plan and outstanding as of the date of the Annual Meeting which expire or terminate after the Annual Meeting, plus • two times the number of shares subject to restricted stock units (“RSUs”) or restricted awards granted under the 2014 Plan that are outstanding as of the date of the Annual Meeting that are forfeited or terminated or with respect to which shares are withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations after the date of the Annual Meeting. The maximum number of shares that may be issued or transferred pursuant to awards under the 2022 Plan as a result of applying the share limit formula described above will not exceed 1,274,374,682 shares. Shares issued with respect to full-value awards (RSUs or restricted stock awards) granted under the 2022 Plan are counted against the 2022 Plan’s aggregate share limit as two shares for every one share actually issued in connection with the full-value award. The 2022 Plan also includes other rules for counting shares against the share limits. The foregoing brief description is qualified in its entirety by the text of the 2022 Plan, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. Underwritten Public Offering of Common Stock On May 2, 2019, Tesla, Inc. (the “ Company ”) entered into an underwriting agreement (the “ Common Stock Underwriting Agreement ”) with Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and Citigroup Global Markets Inc., acting for themselves and as representatives of the several underwriters named in Schedule I to each of the Underwriting Agreements, as defined below (collectively, the “ Underwriters ”), to issue and sell 3,086,419 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “ Common Stock ”), of the Company in a public offering pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333- 231168 ) (the “ Registration Statement ”) and a related prospectus, including the related prospectus supplement (the “ Common Stock Prospectus Supplement ”), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “ Common Stock Offering ”). In addition, the Company granted the Underwriters an option to purchase, for a period of 30 calendar days from May 7, 2019, up to an additional 462,962 shares of Common Stock. The Company estimates that the net proceeds from the Common Stock Offering will be approximately $737.0 million, or approximately $847.6 million if the Underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase the additional shares of Common Stock, after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses. The Common Stock Underwriting Agreement and a copy of the summary of the terms of the Common Stock Offering included in the Common Stock Prospectus Supplement are filed as Exhibit 1.1 and Exhibit 99.1, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by reference. Underwritten Public Offering of 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes due May 15, 2024 On May 2, 2019, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement (the “ Note Underwriting Agreement ” and together with the Common Stock Underwriting Agreement, the “ Underwriting Agreements ”) with the Underwriters to issue and sell $1.60 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes due May 15, 2024 (the “ Notes ”) in a public offering pursuant to the Registration Statement and a related prospectus, including the related prospectus supplement (the “ Note Prospectus Supplement ”), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “ Note Offering ”). In addition, the Company granted the Underwriters an option to purchase, for a period of 30 calendar days from May 7, 2019, up to an additional $240.0 million aggregate principal amount of Notes solely to cover over-allotments. The Company estimates that the net proceeds from the Note Offering will be approximately $1.58 billion, or approximately $1.82 billion if the Underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase the additional Notes, after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses. The Note Underwriting Agreement and a copy of the summary of the terms of the Note Offering included in the Note Prospectus Supplement are filed as Exhibit 1.2 and 99.2, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by reference. The Notes will be issued pursuant to a supplemental indenture to be entered into supplementing the Indenture, dated May 22, 2013, by and between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. Note Hedge Transactions On May 2, 2019, in connection with the offering of the Notes, the Company entered into note hedge transactions (the “ Note Hedge Transactions ”) with each of Société Générale, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, and Credit Suisse Capital LLC, with Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC as agent, or their respective affiliates (the “ Hedge Counterparties ”) pursuant to call option confirmations in substantially the form filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and which is incorporated herein by reference. The Note Hedge Transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to the Common Stock and/or offset potential cash payments in excess of the principal amount upon any conversion of the Notes in the event that the market value per share of the Common Stock, as measured under the terms of the Note Hedge Transactions, is greater than the strike prices of the Note Hedge Transactions (which corresponds to the initial conversion prices of the Notes and is subject to certain adjustments substantially similar to those contained in the Notes). The Company expects to use approximately $413.8 million from the net proceeds from the issuance and sale of the Notes to pay for the Note Hedge Transactions. If the Underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional Notes pursuant to the Note Underwriting Agreement, the Company expects to enter into additional note hedge transactions, in substantially the form filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, with the Hedge Counterparties with respect to such additional Notes. Warrant Transactions On May 2, 2019, in connection with the offering of the Notes, the Company entered into warrant confirmations with the Hedge Counterparties (the “ Warrant Confirmations ”), in substantially the form filed as Exhibit 10.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and which is incorporated herein by reference, pursuant to which the Company issued certain warrants (the “ Warrants ”). The Warrants allow the Hedge Counterparties to acquire, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, up to approximately 10.3 million shares of Common Stock at a strike price of $607.50 per share in respect of Warrants, which is also subject to adjustment. The Warrants would separately have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market value per share of the Common Stock exceeds the strike price of the Warrants unless, subject to the terms of the Warrant Confirmations, the Company elects to cash settle the Warrants. The Warrants were issued pursuant to the exemption provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Warrants are separate transactions, entered into by the Company with the Hedge Counterparties, and are not part of the terms of the Notes. Holders of the Notes will not have any rights with respect to the Warrants. The Company expects to receive aggregate proceeds of approximately $151.7 million from the sale of the Warrants to the Hedge Counterparties. If the Underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional Notes pursuant to the Note Underwriting Agreement and the Company enters into additional note hedge transactions with the Hedge Counterparties, the Company expects to enter into additional corresponding warrant confirmations, in substantially the form filed as Exhibit 10.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, with the Hedge Counterparties. Item 3.03. Material Modification to Rights of Security Holders. On May 1, 2019, in connection with the Common Stock Offering and the Note Offering, the Company and the holders of at least the minimum number of shares of securities of the Company required to waive certain registration rights under the Company’s investors’ rights agreement waived their registration rights thereunder related to the Common Stock Offering and the Note Offering. A copy of the waiver is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference. Item 8.01. Other Events.

Summary In order to support Tesla’s direct vehicle leasing program, Tesla’s subsidiaries from time to time establish warehouse credit facilities where Tesla is not a guarantor or otherwise a party. On December 28, 2018, the credit facility that was established in 2017 was terminated following its full repayment as a result of a securitization of the underlying assets, and a new credit facility was established to replace it. The total lender commitment under the now-outstanding warehouse credit facilities remains $1.1 billion, the same amount as prior to these transactions. Material Transaction Terms As previously reported, (i) Tesla Finance LLC (“ TFL ”) and Tesla 2014 Warehouse SPV LLC are parties to a Loan and Security Agreement dated August 31, 2016 with Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch (“ DB ”) as administrative agent and the other parties thereto (as amended, the “ 2016 Warehouse Agreement ”), and (ii) TFL and LML Warehouse SPV, LLC, an indirect Tesla subsidiary, were parties to a Loan and Security Agreement dated August 17, 2017 with DB as administrative agent and the other parties thereto (as amended, the “ 2017 Warehouse Agreement ”). On December 28, 2018: • The 2017 Warehouse Agreement was terminated following the payment in full of all obligations thereunder as result of a securitization of the leased vehicle assets collateralizing the 2017 Warehouse Agreement. • TFL and LML 2018 Warehouse SPV, LLC, an indirect Tesla subsidiary, entered into a Loan and Security Agreement having substantially the same terms as the 2017 Warehouse Agreement (the “ 2018 Warehouse Agreement ”) with DB as administrative agent and the other parties thereto. The obligations under the 2018 Warehouse Agreement, including and subject to customary events of default, covenants and limitations, are secured by the right to the proceeds of certain lease contracts and leased vehicles. The loan interest rate is generally based on (i) LIBOR plus a fixed margin (a sum currently equal to approximately 3.9%), or (ii) the interest rate of short-term commercial paper notes used by certain lenders to maintain their loans. The ability to draw under the 2018 Warehouse Agreement is scheduled to end on August 16, 2019, and the maturity date is in September 2020, each subject to specified acceleration or extension conditions. • The 2016 Warehouse Agreement was amended to, among other things, reflect the termination of the 2017 Warehouse Agreement and the entry into the 2018 Warehouse Agreement. The 2016 Warehouse Agreement and the 2018 Warehouse Agreement share an aggregate lender commitment of $1.1 billion, the same amount as the aggregate lender commitment previously shared by the 2016 Warehouse Agreement and the 2017 Warehouse Agreement. As of January 4, 2019, there was nothing drawn on the 2016 Warehouse Agreement and $92.0 million drawn on the 2018 Warehouse Agreement.

Tesla also announced that upon Mr. Ahuja’s retirement, Tesla intends to appoint Zachary Kirkhorn, Tesla’s current Vice President, Finance, Financial Planning and Business Operations, to replace Mr. Ahuja as Tesla’s Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Kirkhorn joined Tesla in March 2010 to lead cost reduction and manufacturing efficiency efforts for the Tesla Roadster. He has since played critical roles in the development and execution of a number of major programs, including site selection and launch of Gigafactory 1 and the launches and ramps of Model X and Model 3. “I’d like to thank Deepak for his tremendous contributions to Tesla,” said Elon Musk, Tesla’s Chief Executive Officer. “Zach has been with Tesla for nine years, and he is incredibly talented and very well-known and respected among the Tesla team. We’re looking forward to him serving in his new role as CFO.” “I’ve been very inspired by Elon and the entire Tesla team. People here are brilliant, very passionate about the company’s mission and more driven than I have seen anywhere else,” said Mr. Ahuja. “It’s difficult to leave, but Tesla has now had two great quarters of profitability, and cash flow generation, which puts the company on a much more solid financial foundation to achieve future successes. I’m very confident in Zach’s leadership, and I’ve seen firsthand how he has proven himself over the years.” “I joined Tesla because I was so attracted to the company’s mission and vision,” said Mr. Kirkhorn. “We’re starting 2019 in a very strong financial position, and my focus is on continuing our momentum on cost management and operational efficiency so that we can get our products to more people and ultimately help us achieve our mission to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.” SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Item 8.01 Other Events On May 7, 2019, Tesla, Inc. (the “ Company ”) closed its previously announced underwritten public offerings of (1) 3,549,381 shares of common stock of the Company, par value $0.001 per share (the “ Common Stock ”), which includes 462,962 shares sold pursuant to the underwriters’ (the “ Underwriters ”) option to purchase additional shares, which was exercised in full on May 3, 2019; and (2) $1.84 billion aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes due May 15, 2024 (the “ Notes ”), which includes $240.0 million aggregate principal amount of Notes sold pursuant to the Underwriters’ option to purchase additional Notes (the “ Option Notes ”), which was exercised in full on May 3, 2019, in each case pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-231168) (the “ Registration Statement ”) and accompanying prospectus, together with the related prospectus supplements for the underwritten public offerings of the Common Stock and the Notes, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In connection with these offerings, the legal opinion as to the legality of the Common Stock and the Notes sold is being filed as Exhibit 5.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein and into the Registration Statement by reference. Supplemental Indenture Relating to Convertible Senior Notes On May 7, 2019, the Company entered into a Fifth Supplemental Indenture relating to the issuance by the Company of the Notes (the “ Supplemental Indenture ”) supplementing the Indenture, dated May 22, 2013 (the “ Base Indenture ,” and together with the Supplemental Indenture, the “ Indenture ”), by and between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association , as trustee (the “ Trustee ”). The Notes will bear interest at a rate of 2.00% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing November 15, 2019. The Notes will mature on May 15, 2024, unless, in each case, earlier repurchased by the Company or converted pursuant to their respective terms. The initial conversion rate of the Notes is 3.2276 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes (which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $309.83 per share). The conversion rate for the Notes will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events but will not be adjusted for accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, upon the occurrence of a “make-whole fundamental change” (as defined in the Supplemental Indenture), the Company will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate by a number of additional shares for a holder that elects to convert the Notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change. Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding February 15, 2024 , the Notes will be convertible o nly under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after September 30, 2019 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the Common Stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive ) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any fi ve consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes for each trading day of such period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of Common Stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after February 15, 2024 , until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert the Notes at any time. Upon c onversion, the Notes will be settled in cash, shares of Common Stock or a combination thereof, at the Company’s election. The Company may not redeem the Notes prior to the maturity date; however, upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the Supplemental Indenture), holders may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of the Notes for cash at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change purchase date. The Notes will be the Company’s senior unsecured obligations and will rank senior in right of payment to any of the Company’s indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, will rank equally in right of payment with any of the Company’s unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated, including the Company’s outstanding 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2021, 2.375% Convertible Senior Notes due 2022, and 5.30% Senior Notes due 2025, and will be effectively junior in right of payment to any of the Company’s secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and will be structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of the Company’s subsidiaries. Each of the following events is considered an “event of default” with respect to the Notes, which may result in the acceleration of the maturity of the Notes: (1) a default in any payment of interest on the Notes when due and payable and the default continues for a period of 30 days; (2) a default in the payment of principal of the Notes when due and payable at the stated maturity, upon any required purchase, upon declaration of acceleration or otherwise; (3) the Company’s failure to comply with its obligation to convert the Notes upon exercise of a holder’s conversion right for a period of five business days; (4) the Company’s failure to comply with its obligations under the Indenture with respect to consolidation, merger and sale of assets of the Company; (5) the Company’s failure to give a fundamental change notice at the time, in the manner, and with the contents under the Indenture when due; (6) the Company’s failure for 60 days after written notice from the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding has been received to comply with any of the Company’s other agreements contained in the Global Note (as defined below) or the Indenture; (7) a default by the Company or any “significant subsidiary” (as defined in the Supplemental Indenture) with respect to any mortgage, agreement or other instrument under which there may be outstanding, or by which there may be secured or evidenced, any indebtedness for money borrowed in excess of $500 million (or its foreign currency equivalent) in the aggregate of the Company and/or any such subsidiary, whether such indebtedness now exists or shall hereafter be created constituting a failure to pay the principal of any such debt when due and payable at its stated maturity, upon required purchase, upon declaration of acceleration or otherwise, unless such principal is paid (or the indebtedness with respect thereto is discharged) or such payment of such principal is waived or is otherwise no longer due and payable or such acceleration is rescinded or annulled prior to a date that is 30 days after written notice from the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Not es (provided, however, that if such principal is paid (or the indebtedness with respect thereto is discharged) or such payment of such principal is waived or is otherwise no longer due and payable or such acceleration is rescinded or annulled , then the event of default by reason of the failure to pay such principal when due shall be deemed not to have occurred); and (8) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency, or reorganization of the Company or any “significant subsidiary.” If an event of default occurs with respect to the Notes, and is continuing (other than an event of default described in clause (8) above with respect to the Company (and not with respect to a “significant subsidiary”)), the Trustee by notice to the Company, or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes, by notice to the Company and the Trustee, may declare 100% of the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes to be due and payable; upon such a declaration, such principal and any accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable immediately, subject to certain limitations in the case of an event of default relating to certain failures by the Company to make certain filings required by it to be made with the Trustee or the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, respectively. Upon an event of default described in clause (8) above with respect to the Company, 100% of the aggregate principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes will automatically be due and payable immediately. The summary of the foregoing transactions is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Base Indenture, the Supplemental Indenture, and the Form of 2.00% Convertible Senior Note due May 15, 2024 included in the Supplemental Indenture (the “ Global Note ”), which are filed as Exhibits 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3, respectively, with this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated herein and into the Registration Statement by reference. Additional Note Hedge Transactions On May 3, 2019, in connection with the exercise of the Underwriters’ option to purchase the Option Notes, the Company entered into additional note hedge transactions (the “ Additional Note Hedge Transactions ”) with each of Société Générale, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, and Credit Suisse Capital LLC, with Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC as agent, or their respective affiliates (the “ Hedge Counterparties ”) , pursuant to call option confirmations in substantially the form of Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, which is incorporated herein by reference. The Additional Note Hedge Transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to the Common Stock, and/or offset potential cash payments in excess of the principal amount upon any conversion of the Option Notes in the event that the market value per share of the Common Stock, as measured under the terms of the Additional Note Hedge Transactions, is greater than the strike prices of the Additional Note Hedge Transactions (which correspond to the initial conversion price of the Notes and are subject to certain adjustments substantially similar to those contained in the Notes). On May 7, 2019, at the closing of the offering of the Notes, the Company paid an aggregate amount of approximately $475.8 million to the Hedge Counterparties for note hedge transactions in connection with the Notes, including approximately $62.1 million for the Additional Note Hedge Transactions . Additional Warrant Transactions On May 3, 2019, in connection with the exercise of the Underwriters’ option to purchase the Option Notes, the Company entered into additional warrant confirmations with each of the Hedge Counterparties in substantially the form of Exhibit 10.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, which is incorporated herein by reference, pursuant to which the Company issued certain warrants (the “ Additional Warrants ”). The Additional Warrants allow the Hedge Counterparties to acquire, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, up to approximately 1.5 million shares of Common Stock at a strike price of $607.50 per share, which is also subject to adjustment. The Additional Warrants would separately have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market value per share of the Common Stock exceeds the strike p rice of the Additional Warrants unless, subj ect to the terms of the warra nt confirmations, the Company elects to cash settle the Additional Warrants. The Additional Warrants were issued pursuant to the exemption provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as ame nded. The Additional Warrants are separate transacti ons, entered into by the Company with the Hedge C ounterparties, and are not part of the terms of the Option Notes. Holders of the Option Notes will not have any rights with respect to the Additional Warrants. On May 7, 2019 , at the closin g of the offering of the Notes, the Company received aggregate proceeds of approximately $ 174. 4 million from the sale of warrant s in connection with the Notes, including approximately $ 22.8 million for the Additional Warrants.

In return, Tesla will pay Mr. Musk a one-time fee of $972,361.

(“ Tesla ”) entered into a credit agreement (the “ RCF Credit Agreement ”) with Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and the lenders and other agents party thereto. The RCF Credit Agreement provides for a senior unsecured revolving credit facility of up to $5.0 billion (the “ Credit Facility ”), which Tesla may draw upon from time to time. Tesla may increase the total commitments under the Credit Facility by up to an additional $2.0 billion, subject to certain conditions, potentially increasing the Credit Facility to $7.0 billion. The Credit Facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit. The proceeds of the loans may be used for general corporate purposes or for any other purpose not otherwise prohibited by the RCF Credit Agreement. The Credit Facility terminates, and all outstanding loans, if any, become due and payable on January 20, 2028. Tesla may request up to two one-year extensions of the facility. No loans were outstanding under the Credit Facility as of January 25, 2023. Outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility accrue interest at a variable rate equal to: • for dollar-denominated loans, at the Company’s election, (a) Term SOFR (the forward-looking secured overnight financing rate) plus 0.10%, or (b) an alternate base rate; • for loans denominated in pounds sterling, SONIA (the sterling overnight index average reference rate); or • for loans denominated in euros, an adjusted EURIBOR rate; in each case, plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin will be based on the rating assigned to Tesla’s senior, unsecured long-term indebtedness from time to time. Tesla accrues a fee based on the daily unused portion of the Credit Facility. Such fee is also based on the rating assigned to Tesla’s senior, unsecured long-term indebtedness from time to time and is payable quarterly. The Credit Facility contains covenants that are usual for this type of facility. These covenants include, among others, restrictions on liens and the incurrence of debt by Tesla’s subsidiaries, each subject to exceptions and limitations. The Credit Facility also requires that Tesla maintain $1.0 billion of liquidity (as calculated pursuant to the RCF Credit Agreement). The Credit Facility contains customary events of default.

As a result, on April 18, 2019, each of Brad Buss, Antonio Gracias, Stephen Jurvetson, and Linda Johnson Rice agreed collectively with the Board and its Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee that each of them will not stand for re-election to the Board at the expiration of their respective current terms, which will be at the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders for Mr. Buss and Ms. Rice, at the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders for Mr. Jurvetson and, if our stockholders approve a director term reduction proposal as described in the Preliminary Proxy Statement, for Mr. Gracias. If our stockholders do not approve such proposal, Mr. Gracias’ term will end at the 2021 annual meeting of stockholders.

On February 28, 2019, Tesla, Inc. (“ Tesla ”) published on its website the following blog post: * * * $35,000 Tesla Model 3 Available Now We are incredibly excited to announce that the standard Model 3, with 220 miles of range, a top speed of 130mph and 0-60mph acceleration of 5.6 seconds is now available at $35,000! Although lower in cost, it is built to achieve the same perfect 5-star safety rating as the longer-ranged version, which has the lowest probability of injury of any car ever tested by the U.S. Government. In addition, we are introducing the Model 3 Standard Range Plus, which offers 240 miles of range, a top speed of 140mph, 0-60mph acceleration of just 5.3 seconds and most premium interior features at $37,000 before incentives. For 6% more money, you get 9% more range, more power, and an upgraded interior. To achieve these prices while remaining financially sustainable, Tesla is shifting sales worldwide to online only. You can now buy a Tesla in North America via your phone in about 1 minute, and that capability will soon be extended worldwide. We are also making it much easier to try out and return a Tesla, so that a test drive prior to purchase isn’t needed. You can now return a car within 7 days or 1,000 miles for a full refund. Quite literally, you could buy a Tesla, drive several hundred miles for a weekend road trip with friends and then return it for free. With the highest consumer satisfaction score of any car on the road, we are confident you will want to keep your Model 3. Shifting all sales online, combined with other ongoing cost efficiencies, will enable us to lower all vehicle prices by about 6% on average, allowing us to achieve the $35,000 Model 3 price point earlier than we expected. Over the next few months, we will be winding down many of our stores, with a small number of stores in high-traffic locations remaining as galleries, showcases and Tesla information centers. The important thing for customers in the United States to understand is that, with online sales, anyone in any state can quickly and easily buy a Tesla. At the same time, we will be increasing our investment in the Tesla service system, with the goal of same-day, if not same-hour service, and with most service done by us coming to you, rather than you coming to us. Moreover, we guarantee service availability anywhere in any countries in which we operate. We’re also excited to announce that we’re implementing a number of firmware upgrades for both new and existing customers. These upgrades will increase the range of the Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive Model 3 to 325 miles, increase the top speed of Model 3 Performance to 162mph, and add an average of approximately 5% peak power to all Model 3 vehicles. Tesla is committed to making not just the best electric cars, but the best cars, period. And our products are the reason we continue to rank #1 in Consumer Reports owner satisfaction survey and have every single year since Tesla was first eligible to be included in 2013. Both Model 3 Standard and Standard Plus are available starting today at Tesla.com . * * * Also on February 28, 2019, Tesla announced that with the impact of the announced changes, it does not expect to be profitable in the first quarter of 2019, but it expects that profitability in the second quarter is likely. Forward-Looking Statements Certain statements herein, including statements regarding future profitability, are “forward-looking statements” that are subject to risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially, including the risks identified in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Tesla, Inc. is clarifying the following statement made by Elon Musk, Tesla’s Chief Executive Officer, during Tesla’s fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results conference call held on February 7, 2018: “[We] expect the new automated lines to arrive next month in March. And then it's already working in Germany so that’s going to be disassembled, brought out to the Gigafactory and reassembled and then go into operation at the Gigafactory. It's not a question whether it works or not. It's just a question of disassembly, transport and reassembly. So we expect to alleviate that constraint. With alleviating that constraint, that's what gets us to the roughly 2,000 to 2,500 unit per week production rate.” The “2,000 to 2,500” units per week cited in this comment refers solely to the capacity of the additional automated battery module manufacturing equipment that is currently located in Germany, and not to Tesla’s total Model 3 production run rate or to the capacity of the automated battery module equipment that is already present at Gigafactory 1. Tesla’s ability to meet its target of 2,500 per week by end of Q1 2018 is not dependent on the additional equipment that is currently located in Germany, as that equipment is expected to start ramping production during Q2 2018. With respect to battery module production, Tesla’s ability to meet its target of 2,500 per week by end of Q1 2018 is dependent only on the equipment that is already present at Gigafactory 1, as well as the incremental capacity that is currently being added through the semi-automated lines that were also discussed during the conference call. As stated in Tesla’s Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Update Letter: “We continue to target weekly Model 3 production rates of 2,500 by the end of Q1 and 5,000 by the end of Q2. It is important to note that while these are the levels we are focused on hitting and we have plans in place to achieve them, our prior experience on the Model 3 ramp has demonstrated the difficulty of accurately forecasting specific production rates at specific points in time. What we can say with confidence is that we are taking many actions to systematically address bottlenecks and add capacity in places like the battery module line where we have experienced constraints, and these actions should result in our production rate significantly increasing during the rest of Q1 and through Q2.” This information is intended to be furnished under 7.01 of Form 8-K and shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “ Exchange Act ”), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

Summary On December 18, 2019, a subsidiary of Tesla, Inc. (“ Tesla ”) entered into agreements with a syndicate of lenders in China for: (i) a secured term loan facility of up to RMB 9.0 billion and (ii) an unsecured revolving loan facility of up to RMB 2.25 billion, in each case to be used in connection with our Gigafactory Shanghai. On December 20, 2019, proceeds from one of the new facilities were used to repay in full the subsidiary’s drawn amounts on its existing bridge loan facility of up to RMB 3.5 billion, which was terminated as a result of the full repayment. Tesla Shanghai Fixed Asset Term Facility Agreement On December 18, 2019, Tesla (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. (“ Tesla Shanghai ”) entered into a Fixed Asset Syndication Loan Agreement and a Supplemental Agreement (together, the “ Fixed Asset Facility ”) with China Construction Bank Corporation, China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone Special Area Branch, Agricultural Bank of China Shanghai Changning Sub-branch, Shanghai Pudong Development Bank Co., Ltd., Shanghai Branch, and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited, China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone Special Area Branch, as lenders (the “ Lenders ”). Under the Fixed Asset Facility, Tesla Shanghai may for a period of three years draw funds from time to time on a secured term facility of up to a total of RMB 9.0 billion (or the equivalent amount drawn in U.S. dollars). The proceeds of such loans may be used only for expenditures related to the construction of and production at our Gigafactory Shanghai or to repay certain outstanding debt of Tesla Shanghai, including under its RMB 3.5 billion Syndication Loan Agreement, dated March 1, 2019, under which each Lender or its affiliate was also a lender (the “ Bridge Loan ”). The Fixed Asset Facility is secured by the land and buildings at Gigafactory Shanghai and is non-recourse to Tesla or its assets. Outstanding borrowings pursuant to the Fixed Asset Facility accrue interest at a rate equal to: (i) for RMB-denominated loans, the market quoted interest rate published by the People’s Bank of China minus 0.7625%, and (ii) for U.S. dollar-denominated loans, the sum of one-year LIBOR plus 1.3%. Starting on the third anniversary of the first borrowing, Tesla Shanghai must also repay principal amounts on a specified schedule, such that all outstanding loans will be repaid by the fifth anniversary of the first borrowing. Tesla Shanghai is subject to certain covenants, including a restriction on liens and other security interests on assets, other than specified exceptions, as well as certain customary covenants and events of default. Tesla Shanghai Working Capital Revolving Facility Agreement On December 18, 2019, Tesla Shanghai entered into a Syndication Revolving Loan Agreement (the “ Working Capital Facility ”) with the Lenders. Under the Working Capital Facility, Tesla Shanghai may draw funds from time to time on an unsecured revolving facility of up to a total of RMB 2.25 billion (or the equivalent amount drawn in U.S. dollars). The proceeds of such loans may be used only for expenditures related to production at our Gigafactory Shanghai. The Working Capital Facility will terminate and all outstanding loans will mature on the first anniversary of the first borrowing under the loan, and the Working Capital Facility is non-recourse to Tesla or its assets . Outstanding borrowings pursuant to the Working Capital Facility accrue interest at a rate equal to: (i) for RMB-denominated loans, the market quoted interest rate published by the People’s Bank of China minus 0.425%, and (ii) for U.S. dollar-denominated loans, the sum of one-year LIBOR plus 0.8%. Tesla Shanghai is subject to certain covenants, including a restriction on liens and other security interests on inventory and accounts receivable, other than specified exceptions, as well as certain customary covenants and events of default. Repayment of Tesla Shanghai Bridge Loan On December 20, 2019, Tesla Shanghai used proceeds from the Fixed Asset Facility to repay in full all of the then-outstanding obligations under the Bridge Loan, which was then terminated.

As previously disclosed, in April 2017 Plug Power Inc. (the “Company”) issued a warrant to Amazon.com NV Investment Holdings LLC to acquire up to 55,286,696 shares of the Company’s common stock. The vesting of the warrant is linked to payments made by Amazon.com, Inc. and its affiliates to the Company pursuant to existing commercial agreements. As of November 2, 2020, 34,917,912 shares had vested under the warrant at an exercise price of $1.1893 per share based on total cumulative spending with the Company in excess of $200 million. Under the terms of the warrant, at the same time the exercise price for the unvested 20,368,784 shares was set at $13.81005 per share. On December 31, 2020, the Company waived the remaining vesting conditions under the warrant, which resulted in the vesting of the remaining 20,368,784 unvested shares under the warrant. This vesting is expected to result in a substantial one-time non-cash charge in the quarter ended December 31, 2020, to eliminate the need to recognize future quarterly non-cash charges for this warrant and to simplify the Company’s financial reporting going forward. The details of the warrant and vesting will be described in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2020 to be filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Forward-Looking Statements This Current Report on Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the expectation of a substantial one-time non-cash charge in the quarter ended December 31, 2020 and the elimination of future quarterly non-cash charges. Although the Company presently believes that the plans, expectations and anticipated results expressed in or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 8-K are reasonable, all forward-looking statements are inherently subjective, uncertain and subject to change, as they involve substantial risks and uncertainties, including those beyond the Company’s control. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for the Company to predict the nature, or assess the potential impact, of each new factor on the Company’s business. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed in the Company’s filings and reports with the SEC, including the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, as amended and supplemented by the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2020, June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2020, as well as other filings and reports that are filed by the Company from time to time with the SEC. The Company disclaims any obligation to update forward-looking statements. 2 SIGNATURE Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Emerging growth company ¨ If an emerging growth company, indicate by check mark if the registrant has elected not to use the extended transition period for complying with any new or revised financial accounting standards provided pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act. ¨ Item 2.06 Material Impairments. The information contained in Item 4.02(a) of this Current Report on Form 8-K regarding the expected impairment relating to certain long-lived assets is incorporated herein by reference. Plug Power Inc. (the “Company”) is not able to estimate the impairment charges at this time, but the charges are not expected to result in any future cash expenditures. Item 4.02 Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review . (a) On March 12, 2021, management and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Audit Committee”) of the Company, in consultation with KPMG LLP (“KPMG”), the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, determined that the Company’s previously issued financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, and as of and for each of the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, June 30, 2020 and 2019, and September 30, 2020 and 2019 (collectively, the “Prior Period Financial Statements”), should no longer be relied upon due to errors in accounting primarily relating to (i) the reported book value of right of use assets and related finance obligations (“ROU Accounting”), (ii) loss accruals for certain service contracts, (iii) the impairment of certain long-lived assets, and (iv) the classification of certain expenses previously included in research and development costs ((i) through (iv) collectively, the “Restatement Items”). In addition, the fourth quarter and full year 2020 financial results and related discussion included in the Company’s shareholder letter furnished on the Form 8-K filed by the Company on February 25, 2021 should no longer be relied upon. The Company and the Audit Committee have determined that these accounting changes will require a restatement of the Prior Period Financial Statements. The revised accounting for the Restatement Items will change how the Company accounts for certain transactions and items, but the revised accounting is not expected to impact cash and cash equivalents or the economics of the Company’s existing or future commercial arrangements. The Company currently anticipates that the primary impact of the revised accounting on the Prior Period Financial Statements will include: · Adjustments on the balance sheets to reduce the carrying amount of certain right of use assets and finance obligations associated with leases; · An increase in the loss accrual relating to certain service contracts; · Recognition of non-cash impairment charges relating to certain long-lived assets, including certain right of use assets and certain fixed assets; and · A reclassification of certain costs resulting in a decrease in Operating expenses - Research and development expense and a corresponding increase in Cost of revenue. In addition to the above, the Company expects to correct certain less significant items in its previously issued financial statements and other financial data. The Company also expects that its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 will disclose a material weakness in its internal controls over financial reporting arising from the Restatement Items. As such, KPMG’s report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 should no longer be relied upon. The changes that will be recorded did not result from a change in published accounting guidance during the relevant time period or any override of controls or misconduct, and KPMG has not informed the Audit Committee of any issues related to an override of controls or misconduct. 2 The accounting related to the Restatement Items is complex and technical and involves significant judgments in applying U.S. GAAP, which is compounded by the unprecedented, dynamic, and innovative nature of the Company’s business and its position in a nascent and rapidly developing industry. In September 2018, the Company adopted ASC Topic 842, effective January 1, 2018, relating to the accounting treatment of leases, including the ROU Accounting. The Company determined its ROU Accounting after significant input from external accounting advisors as well as discussions with KPMG in the audit process. Subsequently, KPMG issued unqualified audit opinions on the Company’s financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019. As part of the Company’s normal process, prior to releasing the Company’s preliminary results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2020, and prior to completion of the audit, on February 24, 2021 the Company and the Audit Committee discussed such results with KPMG, and, at that time, no material issues were raised. After the Company reported its 2020 fourth quarter and year end results, in the course of finalizing the audit with respect to the Company’s financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company and KPMG identified the Restatement Items. The Company has since reevaluated such accounting and determined that it must correct the previous accounting for the Restatement Items. The Company expects to restate its financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 and for each of the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, June 30, 2020 and 2019, September 30, 2020 and 2019, and December 31, 2019, in its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company will not be able to file its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 by the March 16, 2021 deadline, but it is working diligently to finalize the restated financial statements and to file its Form 10-K as soon as practicable. The Company’s internal review is ongoing and the Company may identify further errors. There can be no assurance that the actual effects of the error corrections will be only as described above. The Audit Committee and Company management have discussed with KPMG the matters disclosed in this Item 4.02(a). Forward-Looking Statements This Current Report on Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the nature and extent of the accounting changes and errors and the expected impact of the accounting changes and the restatement on the Company’s prior and future financial statements, financial position and results of operation. These forward-looking statements are made as of the date hereof and are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections as well as the beliefs and assumptions of management. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which involve factors or circumstances that are beyond the Company’s control. The Company’s actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the risk that additional information may arise prior to the filing of the restated financial statements; the final determination of the Audit Committee regarding matters relating to its internal review; the timing and ultimate conclusions of KPMG regarding the audit of the Company’s financial statements, and the risk that the completion and filing of the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K will take longer than expected. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed in the Company’s filings and reports with the SEC, including the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, as amended and supplemented by the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2020, June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2020, as well as other filings and reports that are filed by the Company from time to time with the SEC. The Company disclaims any obligation to update forward-looking statements . 3 SIGNATURE Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

The Private Placement was completed on November 2, 2018. The net proceeds to the Company are expected to be approximately $31 million after deducting placement agent fees and estimated expenses payable by the Company. The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, and agreements by the Company, and customary indemnification and other obligations of the Company and the Purchasers. The foregoing summary of the Purchase Agreement is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Purchase Agreement, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference. The Purchase Agreement is attached hereto as an exhibit to provide investors and security holders with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about the Company. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in Purchase Agreement were made only for purposes of the Purchase Agreement and as of specific dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to the Purchase Agreement, and may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties. The issuance of the Series E Preferred Stock has not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) promulgated thereunder. This current report on Form 8-K does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, any security and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offering would be unlawful. Series E Convertible Preferred Stock General. The Company is authorized to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, with such designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Company’s Board of Directors, without further stockholder approval. The Board of Directors has created out of the authorized and unissued shares of preferred stock a series of preferred stock designated as the Series E Convertible Preferred Stock, comprising up to 35,000 shares of Series E Preferred Stock (the “Preferred Shares”). Stated Value. Each Preferred Share will be issued with an initial Stated Value of $1,000 per share (the “Stated Value”). The Stated Value is subject to reduction upon voluntary or scheduled redemptions or conversions as described in more detail below. Maturity Date. The maturity date of the Series E Preferred Stock will be May 2, 2020, unless extended at the option of the holders of the Preferred Shares (the “Holders”). Ranking. Except for the Company’s Series C Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series C Preferred Stock”), which shall rank senior to the Series E Preferred Stock as to dividends, distributions and payments upon liquidation, dissolution and winding up, and subject to the issuance of capital stock that is of senior or pari-passu rank to the Preferred Shares, all shares of the Company’s capital stock, including common stock, shall be junior in rank to all Preferred Shares with respect to dividends, distributions and payments upon liquidation, dissolution and winding up. Without the prior express written consent of the holders of a majority of the Preferred Shares then outstanding, the Company may not authorize or issue capital stock that is of senior or pari-passu rank to the Preferred Shares in respect of dividends, distributions and payments upon liquidation, dissolution and winding up or any junior stock having a maturity or other date requiring redemption or repayment of such shares of junior stock that is prior to the maturity date of the Preferred Shares. In the event of the Company’s merger or consolidation with or into another corporation, the Preferred Shares shall maintain their relative powers, rights, designations, privileges and preferences. Dividends. Holders of the Preferred Shares are not entitled to receive dividends except in connection with certain purchase rights and other corporate events, as described in the certificate of designations, or in connection with certain distributions of assets, as described in the certificate of designations, or as, when and if declared by the Board of Directors acting in its sole and absolute discretion. 2 Voting Rights . Holders of Preferred Shares shall have no voting rights, except on matters required by law or under the certificate of designations to be submitted to a class vote of the holders of the Preferred Shares. Except where a greater vote is required by law or by another provision of the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation, without first obtaining the affirmative vote or consent of holders of at least a majority of the Preferred Shares then outstanding, voting together as a single class, the Company may not: (a) amend or repeal any provision of, or add any provision to, the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws, or file any certificate of designations or articles of amendment of any series of shares of preferred stock, if such action would adversely alter or change the preferences, rights, privileges or powers, or restrictions provided for the benefit of the Preferred Shares under the certificate of designations, regardless of whether any such action shall be by means of amendment to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation or by merger, consolidation or otherwise; (b) other than as provided under the certificate of designations increase or decrease (other than by conversion) the authorized number of Preferred Shares; (c) create or authorize (by reclassification or otherwise) any new class or series of preferred stock ranking senior to or pari passu with the Preferred Shares; (d) purchase, repurchase or redeem any shares of capital stock, including the common stock, ranking junior to the Preferred Shares (other than pursuant to the terms of the Company’s equity incentive plans and options and other equity awards granted under such plans); (e) pay dividends or make any other distribution on any shares of our capital stock, including the common stock, that rank junior to the Preferred Shares; (f) issue any Preferred Shares other than as contemplated by the certificate of designations; or (g) whether or not prohibited by the terms of the Preferred Shares, circumvent a right of the Preferred Shares under the certificate of designations. Covenants. The Company is required to comply with certain customary covenants, including certain restrictions on incurring indebtedness or entering into agreements, in each case that would prohibit the Company from making cash redemptions of or payments on the Preferred Shares. O ptional Installment Conversion or Redemption by the Company. On the first Trading Day of each calendar month commencing on May 1, 2019 and through, and including, April 1, 2020, and on the Maturity Date (each an “Installment Date”), provided that all Equity Conditions (as defined below) have been satisfied, the Company will convert from the Holders of the Preferred Shares, an amount equal to $2,693,000 in Stated Value of the Preferred Shares (as such amount may be reduced by earlier conversion, redemption or otherwise, the “Installment Amount”) by converting the Installment Amount into shares of its common stock (an “Installment Conversion”); provided, however, that the Company may instead, at its option following notice to the Holders, pay the Installment Amount by redeeming such Installment Amount for cash (an “Installment Redemption”) or by any combination of an Installment Conversion and an Installment Redemption so long as the Company converts and/or redeems all of the outstanding applicable Installment Amount on the applicable Installment Date. In the event of an Installment Conversion, the Company will convert the applicable Installment Amount of the Preferred Shares (such amount to be converted, the “Installment Conversion Amount”) at the greater of (x) $0.55 (the “Floor Price”) and (y) the lowest of (i) the Conversion Price then in effect and (ii) 85% of the average volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) of the Common Stock for the three (3) lowest trading days during the seven (7) consecutive trading day period immediately prior to the applicable Installment Date (the “Installment Conversion Price”). If the Equity Conditions are not satisfied at any time after notice of an Installment Conversion and prior to the applicable Installment Date, then any Holder may require the Company to: (A) redeem all or any part designated by the Holder of the applicable Installment Conversion Amount at 125% of such designated portion of the Installment Conversion Amount, and/or (B) the Installment Conversion shall be null and void with respect to all or any part designated by such Holder of the unconverted Installment Conversion Amount and such Holder shall be entitled to all the rights of a holder of the Preferred Shares with respect to such designated part of the Installment Conversion Amount; provided, however, the Conversion Price for such designated part of such unconverted Installment Conversion Amount shall thereafter be adjusted to equal the lesser of (X) the Installment Conversion Price as in effect on the date on which such Holder voided the Installment Conversion and (Y) the Installment Conversion Price that would be in effect on the date on which such Holder delivers a conversion notice relating thereto as if such date was an Installment Date. In the event of an Installment Redemption, the Company will redeem for cash the applicable Installment Amount (such amount to be redeemed, the “Installment Redemption Amount”) on the applicable Installment Date. If the Company fails to redeem the Installment Redemption Amount on the applicable Installment Date by payment of the applicable redemption price, then at the option of the Holder, the Holder may require the Company to convert all or any part of the Installment Redemption Amount or void the redemption. If the Holder elects to convert, the conversion is at the greater of (x) the Floor Price and (y) the lowest of (i) the Conversion Price then in effect and (ii) 85% of the average VWAP of the Common Stock for the three (3) lowest trading days during the seven (7) consecutive trading day period immediately prior to the date that Holder provides notice of such election. If the Holder elects to void the redemption, the Additional Amount (as described in the certificate of designations) of the applicable Preferred Shares shall be increased by an amount equal to the difference between (1) the applicable redemption price minus (2) the Stated Value portion of the Conversion Amount submitted for redemption and (z) the Conversion Price of such Preferred Shares shall be automatically adjusted with respect to each conversion effected thereafter by 3 such Holder to the lowest of (A) the Conversion Price as in effect on the date on which the applicable redemption is voided, (B) the greater of (x) the Floor Price and (y) 75% of the lowest closing bid price of the common stock during the period described in the certificate of designations and (C) the greater of (x) the Floor Price and (y) 75% of the average five (5) lowest VWAPs of the common stock during the twenty (20) consecutive trading day period specified in the certificate of designations. Subject to certain limitations described in the certificate of designations, each Holder will have the right to defer all or any portion of any Installment Amount to a later or earlier Installment Date, as applicable. The term “Equity Conditions” means, with respect to any given date of determination: (i) on each day during the period beginning thirty (30) calendar days prior to such applicable date of determination and ending on and including such applicable date of determination (the “Equity Conditions Measuring Period”) either (x) one or more registration statements filed pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement (as defined below) will be effective and the prospectus contained therein shall be available on such applicable date of determination for the resale of all shares of common stock to be issued in connection with the event requiring a determination, as applicable, in the event requiring a determination at the Installment Conversion Price assuming an Installment Date as of such date of determination (each, a “Required Minimum Securities Amount”), in each case, in accordance with the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement and there shall not have been during such period any Grace Periods (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) or (y) all Registrable Securities (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreements) shall be eligible for sale pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act without the need for registration under any applicable federal or state securities laws (in each case, disregarding any limitation on conversion of the Preferred Shares, other issuance of securities) and no Current Information Failure (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) exists or is continuing; (ii) on each day during the period beginning thirty calendar days prior to the applicable date of determination and ending on and including the applicable date of determination (the “Equity Conditions Measuring Period”), the common stock (including all shares of common stock issued or issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Shares) is listed or designated for quotation (as applicable) on the NASDAQ Capital Market or on one of several named alternative exchanges (the “Eligible Market”) and shall not have been suspended from trading on an Eligible Market (other than suspensions of not more than two (2) days and occurring prior to the applicable date of determination due to business announcements by the Company) nor shall delisting or suspension by an Eligible Market have been threatened (with a reasonable prospect of delisting occurring after giving effect to all applicable notice, appeal, compliance and hearing periods) or reasonably likely to occur or pending as evidenced by (A) a writing by such Eligible Market or (B) the Company falling below the minimum listing maintenance requirements of the Eligible Market on which the Common Stock is then listed or designated for quotation, as applicable; (iii) during the Equity Conditions Measuring Period, the Company shall have delivered common stock upon conversion of the Preferred Shares on a timely basis; (iv) any shares of common stock to be issued in connection with the event requiring determination (or issuable upon conversion of the Conversion Amount (as defined below) being redeemed in the event requiring this determination) may be issued in full without violating the limitation on beneficial ownership or the rules or regulations of the NASDAQ Capital Market; (v) any shares of common stock to be issued in connection with the event requiring determination (or issuable upon conversion of the Conversion Amount being redeemed in the event requiring this determination (without regards to any limitations on conversion set forth in the certificate of designations)) may be issued in full without violating the rules or regulations of the stock exchange on which the common stock is then listed; (vi) on each day during the Equity Conditions Measuring Period, no public announcement of a pending, proposed or intended fundamental transaction (as described in the certificate of designations) shall have occurred which has not been abandoned, terminated or consummated; (vii) the Company shall have no knowledge of any fact that would reasonably be expected to cause (1) any registration statement required to be filed pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement to not be effective or the prospectus contained therein to not be available for the resale of the applicable Registrable Securities in accordance with the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement or (2) any Registrable Securities to not be eligible for sale pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act without the need for registration under any applicable federal or state securities laws (in each case, disregarding any limitation on conversion of the Preferred Shares, other issuance of securities with respect to the certificate of designations) and no Current Information Failure (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreements) exists or is continuing, (viii) none of the Holders shall be in possession of any material, non-public information provided to any of them by us or any of our subsidiaries or any of our respective affiliates, employees, officers, representatives, agents or the like; (ix) on each day during the Equity Conditions Measuring Period the Company otherwise shall have been in compliance with each, and shall not have breached any representation or warranty in any material respect (other than representations or warranties subject to material adverse effect or materiality, which may not be breached in any respect) or any covenant or other term or condition of any transaction document, including, without limitation, the Company shall not have failed to timely make any payment pursuant to any transaction document; (x) on each trading day during the Equity Conditions Measuring Period (as described in the certificate of designations), (A) the average VWAP of the common stock fails to exceed $0.85 (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, stock combinations, recapitalizations or other similar transactions involving the common stock) or (B) the average aggregate daily dollar trading volume of the common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market fails to be more than $200,000; (xi) on the applicable date of determination (A) no Authorized Share Failure (as described in the certificate of designations) shall exist or be continuing and 100% of the maximum number of shares of common stock then issuable upon conversion of the Preferred 4 Shares (without regard to any limitations on conversion) are available under our certificate of incorporation and reserved to be issued pursuant to the certificate of designations, and (B) all shares of common stock to be issued in connection with the event requiring this determination (or issuable upon conversion of the Conversion Amount being redeemed in the event requiring this determination (without regards to any limitations on conversion set forth herein)) may be issued in full without resulting in an Authorized Share Failure and Required Minimum Securities Amount (as described in the certificate of designations) is available; (xii) on each day during the Equity Conditions Measuring Period, there shall not have occurred and there shall not exist a Triggering Event or an event that with the passage of time or giving of notice would constitute a Triggering Event; (xiii) the Installment Conversion price is not determined by the Floor Price; or (xiv) the shares of common stock issuable pursuant to the event requiring the satisfaction of the Equity Conditions are duly authorized and listed and eligible for trading without restriction on the NASDAQ Capital Market or on one of several named alternative exchanges. Optional Conversion by the Holders. At any time following the issuance of the Preferred Shares, each holder of the Preferred Shares shall be entitled to convert any whole number of Preferred Shares, into fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock. The number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of each Preferred Share shall be determined according to the following formula (the “Conversion Rate”): Conversion Amount Conversion Price The “Conversion Amount” means, with respect to each Preferred Share, as of the applicable date of determination, the Stated Value, plus any declared and unpaid dividends and late charges as provided in the certificate of designations. The “Conversion Price” means $2.31, with respect to each Preferred Share, as of any Conversion Date or other date of determination, subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends, stock combinations, recapitalizations or similar transactions involving our common stock. No fractional shares of common stock are to be issued upon the conversion of any Preferred Share, but rather the number of shares of common stock to be issued will be rounded to the nearest whole number. The conversion of Preferred Shares is governed by the terms set out in the certificate of designations. In the event the Company fails to timely deliver common stock on conversion by a Holder, and after the delivery deadline such Holder purchases shares of our common stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by that Holder, the Company will be required to either pay cash to the Holder in an amount representing its total purchase price for those shares (including commissions and expenses) in lieu of delivering the shares of common stock on conversion, or (at the Holder’s election) deliver shares of common stock plus an amount in cash representing the difference between the Holder’s purchase price for the shares it purchased and the number of shares issued upon conversion multiplied by the VWAP of our common stock on the conversion date. None of the above limits the right that holders of the Preferred Shares have to require the Company to repurchase the Preferred Shares. Mandatory Conversion. The Company has the right, provided that no Equity Conditions Failure exists, to require each Holder of Preferred Shares to convert all or any number of the Preferred Shares held by such Holder (treating all Holders on a proportionate basis) at the Conversion Rate if the closing sale price of our common stock equals at least 175% of the Conversion Price for twenty (20) consecutive trading days. Holder Optional Redemption after Maturity Date . At any time from and after the tenth (10) business day prior to the Maturity Date, any Holder may require the Company to redeem (a “Maturity Redemption”) all or any number of Preferred Shares held by such Holder at a purchase price equal to 105% of the Conversion Amount of such Preferred Shares (the “Maturity Redemption Price”) by delivery of written notice thereof (the “Maturity Redemption Notice”). The Maturity Redemption Notice must state the date that the Company is required to pay to such Holder such Maturity Redemption Price (the “Maturity Redemption Date”), which date may be no earlier than ten (10) business days following the date of delivery of such Maturity Redemption Notice. Such Maturity Redemptions will be conducted in accordance with the redemption provisions contained in the certificate of designations. Redemption/Conversion Option of the Holders upon a Triggering Event. In addition to all other rights of the Holders contained in the certificate of designations, after a Triggering Event (as described below), each Holder will have the right, at such Holder’s option, to require the Company to redeem and/or convert all or a portion of such Holder’s Preferred Shares. Any such Triggering Event redemption would be at a price per Preferred Share equal to the greater of (i) 120% of the Conversion Amount and (ii) the product of (A) the Conversion Rate in effect at such time as such Holder delivers notice of the redemption multiplied by (B) 120% of the greatest closing sale price of the common stock on any trading day during the period specified in the certificate of designations. Any such Triggering Event conversion would be at a conversion rate equal to the quotient of (i) 120% of the Conversion Amount divided by (ii) the lower of (A) the applicable Conversion Price in effect on the trading day 5 immediately preceding the notice of conversion and (B) the greater of (1) the Floor Price and (2) 75% of the lowest VWAP of the common stock on any trading day during the period specified in the certificate of designations. If the Company fails to redeem the required Preferred Shares in any Triggering Event Redemption on the applicable redemption date by payment of the applicable redemption price, then at the Holder shall have the option to require the Company to promptly return to such Holder all or any of the Preferred Shares that were submitted for redemption and for which the applicable redemption price has not been paid. In each case (i) the Additional Amount (as described in the certificate of designations) of such Preferred Shares shall be increased by an amount equal to the difference between (1) the applicable redemption price minus (2) the Stated Value portion of the Conversion Amount submitted for redemption and (ii) the Conversion Price of such Preferred Shares shall be automatically adjusted with respect to each conversion effected thereafter by such Holder to the lowest of (A) the Conversion Price as in effect on the date on which the applicable redemption notice is voided, (B) the greater of (x) the Floor Price and (y) 75% of the lowest closing bid price of the common stock during the period described in the certificate of designations and (C) the greater of (x) the Floor Price and (y) 85% of the average of the five (5) lowest VWAPs of the common stock during the twenty (20) consecutive trading day period ending immediately prior to the applicable conversion date. A “Triggering Event” shall be deemed to have occurred upon any of the following events, among others: (i) any of the Preferred Shares or shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Shares are not freely tradable under Rule 144 of the Securities Act without restriction; (ii) the suspension from trading or failure of the common stock to be listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market (or other eligible market as specified in the certificate of designations) for a period of five (5) consecutive trading days; (iii) (A) the Company’s failure on two or more occasions to timely deliver the required number of shares of common stock after any applicable conversion date or (B) the Company’s notice, written or oral, to any Holder of our intention not to comply, as required, with a request for conversion of any Preferred Shares into shares of common stock that is tendered; (iv) the Company’s failure to pay to the Holder any amounts when and as due pursuant to the certificate of designations or any other transaction document; (v) specified voluntary or involuntary events involving bankruptcy, insolvency, decrees or orders for relief under bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and similar laws, the appointment of a custodian, receiver or similar official, an order for the winding up or liquidation of our affairs, commencement by us of a voluntary case or proceeding under bankruptcy or similar laws, making an assignment for the benefit of creditors, and similar voluntary or involuntary events enumerated in the certificate of designations (in the case of involuntary events, and such events are not dismissed within 60 days); or (vi) the Company breaches any representation, warranty, covenant or other term or condition of any Transaction Document, except, in the case of a breach of a covenant which is curable, only if such breach remains uncured for a period of five (5) consecutive trading days. Redemption Right of the Holders Upon a Change of Control. In the event of a fundamental transaction, as described in the certificate of designations, generally including, among other transactions, any merger with or into another entity in which the Company is not the surviving entity or the Company’s stockholders immediately prior to such merger or consolidation do not own at least 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the surviving entity, or a sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets, each Holder will have the right, at such Holder’s option, to require the Company to redeem all or a portion of such Holder’s Preferred Shares. Any such Change of Control redemption would be at a price per Preferred Share equal to 125% of the greatest of (i) the Conversion Amount being redeemed, (ii) the product of (A) the Conversion Amount being redeemed multiplied by (B) the quotient determined by dividing (1) the greatest closing sale price of the common stock during the period specified in the certificate of designations by (2) the Conversion Price, and (iii) the product of (A) the Conversion Amount being redeemed and (B) the quotient determined by dividing (1) the aggregate cash consideration and the aggregate cash value of any non-cash consideration per share of common stock to be paid to holders of the common stock upon consummation of such Change of Control by (2) the Conversion Price. Fundamental Transactions. The Company will not enter into a “fundamental transaction” unless the successor assumes in writing the Company’s obligations under the certificate of designations and the other Transaction Documents and the successor entity or its parent is a publicly traded corporation whose common stock is quoted on or listed for trading on one of the stock exchanges described in the certificate of designations. Upon the occurrence of a fundamental transaction, the successor entity will 6 succeed to the Company’s obligations. Limitation on Beneficial Ownership. The Company will not effect any conversion of Preferred Shares, and no Holder shall have the right to convert any Preferred Shares, to the extent that after giving effect to such conversion, such Holder (together with its affiliates and certain attributable parties) would beneficially own in excess of 9.99% (the “Maximum Percentage”) of the shares of the Company’s common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such conversion. For purposes of the foregoing, the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by a Holder and its affiliates and attributable parties shall include the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Shares with respect to which the determination is being made, but shall exclude the number of shares of common stock which would be issuable upon (A) conversion of the remaining, nonconverted Preferred Shares beneficially owned by such Holder or any of its affiliates or attributable parties and (B) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or unconverted portion of any other of the Company’s securities beneficially owned by such Holder or any of its affiliates or attributable parties subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained in the certificate of designations. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. By written notice to the Company, the Holder may from time to time increase or decrease the Maximum Percentage to any other percentage not in excess of 9.99%; provided that (i) any such increase will not be effective until the sixty-first (61st) day after such notice is delivered, and (ii) any such increase or decrease will apply only to the Holder providing such written notice to its affiliates and not to any other Holder. Exchange Cap . The Company may not issue any shares of common stock upon conversion of any Preferred Shares or otherwise pursuant to the terms of the Series E Certificate of Designations if the issuance of such shares of common stock would exceed the aggregate number of shares of common stock which the Company may issue upon exercise or conversion (as the case may be) of the Preferred Shares without breaching its obligations under the rules of the Nasdaq Capital Market, unless the Company obtains the approval of its stockholders as required by the applicable rules of the Nasdaq Capital Market for issuances of shares of Common Stock in excess of such amount. Reservation of Shares Issuable Upon Conversion. So long as any Preferred Shares remain outstanding, the Company is required to reserve at least 140% of the number of shares of common stock as shall from time to time be necessary to effect the conversion of all of the Preferred Shares then outstanding (without regard to any limitations on conversions and assuming the Preferred Shares remain outstanding until the maturity date). Liquidation Preference. In the event of either a voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company or its subsidiaries, the assets of which constitute all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, in a single transaction or series of transactions (a “liquidation event”), the Holders shall be entitled to receive in cash out of the Company’s assets, whether from capital or from earnings available for distribution to its stockholders, after any amount (including the Series C Liquidation Amount) that is required to be paid to the Series C Preferred Stock and before any amount shall be paid to the holders of any of capital stock ranking junior to the Preferred Shares, but pari passu with any capital stock then outstanding that ranks pari passu with the Preferred Shares, an amount per Preferred Share equal to the greater of (A) 125% of the Conversion Amount thereof on the date of such payment and (B) the amount per share such Holder would receive if such Holder converted such Preferred Shares into common stock immediately prior to the date of such payment. Transfer of Shares . A Holder may transfer some or all of its Preferred Shares, except that no Preferred Shares may be sold or transferred other than to a U.S. person as described in section 7701(a)(30) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

Stock Purchase Agreement On January 6, 2021, Plug Power Inc. (the “Company”) entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Grove Energy Capital LLC (“Grove Energy”), Plutus Capital NY, Inc. and SK E&S Americas, Inc., each of which is a subsidiary of SK Holdings Co., Ltd. (“SK Holdings”), in connection with a strategic partnership. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed to sell to Grove Energy 51,428,119 shares (subject to adjustment, the “Shares”) of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Common Stock”), at a purchase price of $29.2893 per share or an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.5 billion (the “Investment”). Based on 468,047,829 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding as of January 5, 2021, Grove Energy is expected to own approximately 9.9% of the issued and outstanding Common Stock immediately following the Investment. The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants and conditions to closing of the Investment (the “Closing”), including receipt of all approvals or the termination or expiration of all waiting periods required under applicable antitrust laws. The Purchase Agreement may be terminated by either the Company or Grove Energy if the Closing has not occurred by March 5, 2021, subject to extension to April 2, 2021 in the event antitrust approval has not been obtained. Simultaneous with the execution of the Purchase Agreement, the Company and SK E&S Co., Ltd. (“SK E&S”) entered into a Nonbinding Asia JV Framework Agreement (“JV Agreement”) with respect to a potential joint venture in Asia to bring hydrogen solutions to Korea, China and Vietnam (the “Proposed Asia JV”). The JV Agreement, which is non-binding, outlines certain principal terms for the Proposed Asia JV. The Purchase Agreement provides that the parties will negotiate exclusively with one another for up to eighteen months with respect to the Proposed Asia JV with the objective of executing definitive agreements for the Proposed Asia JV. Investor Agreement In connection with the Investment, the Company, Grove Energy, SK Holdings and SK E&S will enter into an Investor Agreement (the “Investor Agreement”) providing for certain rights and restrictions relating to the Investment. Board Representation. The Investor Agreement provides that Grove Energy will be entitled to designate one person (the “SK Designee”) to be appointed to the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”). The SK Designee will be an individual selected by Grove Energy who is reasonably acceptable to the Board and otherwise meets the requirements for serving on the Board. The SK Designee will be appointed to the Board effective as of the Closing for a term expiring at the Company’s 2023 annual meeting of stockholders. Grove Energy will have the right to require the Board to nominate a SK Designee for election to the Board by the stockholders of the Company at subsequent annual stockholder meetings until the earliest of (i) the date on which Grove Energy and affiliates beneficially own less than 4.0% of the issued and outstanding Common Stock, (ii) the second anniversary of the Closing in the event that the parties to the JV Agreement have not entered into a definitive joint venture agreement with respect to the Proposed Asia JV (the “Definitive Asia JV Agreement”), and (iii) any expiration or termination of the Definitive Asia JV Agreement (the “Director Period”). 2 Standstill Obligations. The Investor Agreement provides that Grove Energy, SK Holdings, SK E&S and their respective affiliates (“SK Parties”) will be subject to a standstill provision until the later of (i) the expiration of the Director Period, (ii) the second anniversary of the Closing, and (iii) the date on which Grove Energy and affiliates beneficially own less than 5.0% of the issued and outstanding Common Stock (the “Standstill Period”). During the Standstill Period, the SK Parties will not, among other things and subject to specified exceptions: (a) acquire any securities of the Company (except for purchases of Common Stock in the public market to the extent necessary to reverse any decrease in such parties’ percentage ownership of the issued and outstanding Common Stock resulting solely from a net increase in the number of shares of issued and outstanding Common Stock); (b) propose any merger, consolidation, business combination, tender offer or similar transaction involving the Company; (c) solicit proxies or consents to vote any securities of the Company; (d) form, join or participate in any group (as such term is used in the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”)); or (e) seek to call a meeting of the stockholders of the Company or propose any matter to be voted upon by the stockholders of the Company. Transfer Restrictions. The Investor Agreement also provides that, for a period ending on the second anniversary of the Closing, the SK Parties will be prohibited from transferring any Common Stock. If immediately following the second anniversary of the Closing, either (i) the Director Period remains in effect or (ii) the Definitive Asia JV Agreement has been executed and remains in effect, then, until the third anniversary of the Closing, the SK Parties may transfer a number of shares of Common Stock not exceeding, in the aggregate in any 90-day period, 2.0% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock as of the first date in such 90-day period. If immediately following the second anniversary of the Closing, both (i) the Director Period has ended and (ii) the Definitive Asia JV Agreement has not been executed or otherwise is not in effect, then the SK Parties may transfer any amount of Common Stock. From and after the third anniversary of the Closing, the SK Parties may transfer any amount of Common Stock. The SK Parties will also be generally prohibited from transferring Common Stock to (a) any competitor of the Company (as determined by the Board) or (b) any person that together with its affiliates would, after giving effect to such transfer, beneficially own 5.0% or more of the issued and outstanding Common Stock. Voting Obligations . The Investor Agreement also provides that, during the Standstill Period, Grove Energy will vote all of its shares of Common Stock (i) for all Board-recommended director nominees and (ii) on each other matter brought to a vote of the Company’s stockholders, in accordance with the recommendation of the Board on such matter. Under the Investor Agreement, Grove Energy has granted a proxy to the Company to vote all such shares of Common Stock in the event that it does not vote such shares at least ten (10) days prior to the date of any meeting of stockholders. Registration Rights. The Investor Agreement includes customary resale shelf registration rights for Grove Energy that require the Company to register the Common Stock held by Grove Energy for resale. The foregoing description of the Purchase Agreement, the Investor Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Purchase Agreement (including the form of Investor Agreement attached as an exhibit thereto), which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference. The Purchase Agreement has been included to provide investors with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates. The representations and warranties contained in the Purchase Agreement were made only for purposes of the Purchase Agreement (together with the exhibits thereto) and as of specific dates, are solely for the benefit of the parties to the Purchase Agreement, may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties, may have been made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the Purchase Agreement instead of establishing these matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Investors are not third-party beneficiaries to the representations and warranties contained in the Purchase Agreement and should not rely on the representations and warranties or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of the parties thereto or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of representations and warranties may change after the date of the Purchase Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the Company’s public disclosures. 3 Item 3.02 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities. The information contained in Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K regarding the Purchase Agreement and the Investment is incorporated herein by reference. The Company will offer and sell the Shares in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The Company will rely on this exemption from registration based in part on representations made by Grove Energy in the Purchase Agreement. Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.

On January 26, 2021, Plug Power Inc. (the “Company”) entered into an underwriting agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, as representative of the several underwriters named in Schedule I thereto (the “Underwriters”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell 28,000,000 shares of its common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Common Stock”), at a public offering price of $65.00 per share (the “Offering”) . Under the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, the Company granted the Underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 4,200,000 shares of Common Stock at the public offering price, less the underwriting discount. The Company estimates that the net proceeds from the Offering, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company, will be approximately $1.8 billion (or approximately $2.0 billion if the Underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares of Common Stock in full). The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, potential acquisitions, growth opportunities and strategic transactions. The Offering is expected to close on or about January 29, 2021, subject to customary closing conditions. The Offering was made pursuant to the Company’s effective registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration Statement No. 333-235328), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 2, 2019, including the prospectus contained therein, and a prospectus supplement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Underwriting Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, covenants and agreements by the Company, customary conditions to closing and indemnification obligations of the Company and the Underwriters, including for liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in the Underwriting Agreement were made only for purposes of such agreement and as of specific dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to such agreement and may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties. The foregoing is a summary description of the Underwriting Agreement and is qualified in its entirety by the text of the Underwriting Agreement attached as Exhibit 1.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference. In connection with the filing of the Underwriting Agreement, the Company is filing as Exhibit 5.1 hereto an opinion of its counsel, Goodwin Procter LLP, regarding the legality of the shares issued in the Offering. Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Current Report on Form 8-K contains certain “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.

Forward-looking statements involve significant known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause the Company's actual results in future periods to differ materially from those projected or contemplated in the forward-looking statements as a result of, but not limited to, the following factors: timing and consummation of the Offering; the intended use of the net proceeds from the Offering; and risks and uncertainties related to market conditions and satisfaction of customary conditions to closing related to the Offering. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed in the Company's filings and reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, as amended and supplemented by the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2020, June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2020, as well as other filings and reports that are filed by the Company from time to time with the SEC.

On November 16, 2020, Plug Power Inc. (the “Company”) entered into an underwriting agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, as representative of the several underwriters named in Schedule I thereto (the “Underwriters”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell 38,000,000 shares of its common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Common Stock”), at a public offering price of $22.25 per share (the “Offering”) . Under the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, the Company granted the Underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 5,700,000 shares of Common Stock at the public offering price, less the underwriting discount. The Company estimates that the net proceeds from the Offering, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company, will be approximately $806.2 million (or approximately $927.2 million if the Underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares of Common Stock in full). The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, potential acquisitions, growth opportunities and strategic transactions. The Offering is expected to close on or about November 19, 2020, subject to customary closing conditions. The Offering was made pursuant to the Company’s effective registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration Statement No. 333-235328), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 2, 2019, including the prospectus contained therein, and a prospectus supplement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Underwriting Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, covenants and agreements by the Company, customary conditions to closing and indemnification obligations of the Company and the Underwriters, including for liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in the Underwriting Agreement were made only for purposes of such agreement and as of specific dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to such agreement and may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties. The foregoing is a summary description of the Underwriting Agreement and is qualified in its entirety by the text of the Underwriting Agreement attached as Exhibit 1.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference. In connection with the filing of the Underwriting Agreement, the Company is filing as Exhibit 5.1 hereto an opinion of its counsel, Goodwin Procter LLP, regarding the legality of the shares issued in the Offering.

Changes in Registrant’s Certifying Accountant. (a) Dismissal of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm On March 16, 2022, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Audit Committee”) of Plug Power Inc. (the “Company”) approved the dismissal of, and dismissed, KPMG LLP (“KPMG”) as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm. The audit reports of KPMG on the consolidated financial statements of the Company for each of the two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. The audit reports of KPMG on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles, except that KPMG’s audit reports for each fiscal year contained an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, related to the below described material weaknesses, and excluded an evaluation of internal control over financial reporting of certain entities acquired by the Company, including Applied Cryo Technologies and Frames Holdings B.V. as of December 31, 2021 and Giner ELX, Inc. and United Hydrogen Group Inc. as of December 31, 2020. During the Company’s two most recent fiscal years and subsequent interim period from January 1, 2022 to March 16, 2022, (i) there were no disagreements (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions to Item 304 of Regulation S-K) with KPMG on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedures, which disagreements if not resolved to KPMG’s satisfaction, would have caused KPMG to make reference to the subject matter of such disagreements in their reports on the Company’s consolidated financial statements for such years, and (ii) there were no “reportable events” as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K, except for the material weaknesses described below. As previously disclosed in Item 9A of the Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K for each of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, and in the amendment to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year 2020, the Company concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2021, 2020, 2019 and 2018 due to certain material weaknesses. In its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 and the accompanying amendment thereto, the Company disclosed a material weakness related to: an insufficient complement of trained, knowledgeable resources to execute the Company’s responsibilities with respect to internal control over financial reporting for certain financial statement accounts and disclosures, which resulted in the Company not conducting an effective risk assessment process that was responsive to changes in the Company's operating environment and not designing and implementing effective process-level controls activities in the following areas: (a) presentation of operating expenses; (b) accounting for lease-related transactions; (c) identification and evaluation of impairment, accrual for loss contracts, certain expense accruals, and deemed dividends; and (d) timely identification of adjustments to physical inventory in interim periods. In its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, the Company disclosed material weaknesses related to: (i) an insufficient complement of trained, knowledgeable resources to execute the Company’s responsibilities with respect to internal control over financial reporting, which resulted in the Company not conducting an effective risk assessment process that was responsive to changes in the Company's operating environment and not designing and implementing effective process-level controls activities for certain financial statement accounts and disclosures as follows: (a) presentation of operating expenses; (b) accrual for loss contracts related to service; and (c) identification of adjustments to physical inventory; and (ii) ineffective general information technology control activities over an information technology system that is used in calculating fuel billings due to the ineffective risk assessment in identifying the relevant system, resulting from not designing and implementing general information technology control activities in response to the current year growth in fuel delivered to customers. The Company provided KPMG with a copy of this Current Report on Form 8-K and requested that KPMG furnish a letter addressed to the SEC stating whether it agrees with the statements made above therein. A copy of KPMG’s letter dated March 21 , 2022 is attached hereto as Exhibit 16.1. (b) Engagement of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm On March 16, 2022, following the completion of a competitive process with several independent registered public accounting firms, the Audit Committee appointed Deloitte & Touche LLP (“Deloitte”) as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022. During the Company’s two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 and subsequent interim period from January 1, 2022 to March 16, 2022, neither the Company nor anyone on its behalf consulted Deloitte regarding (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company’s consolidated financial statements, and neither a written report nor oral advice was provided to the Company that was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to any accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue, or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a “disagreement,” as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K, or a “reportable event,” as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.

In addition, pursuant to the Loan Agreement Amendment the Lender will advance an additional $5 million on or before April 12, 2019 subject to no default or event of default.

The Loan Agreement contains customary covenants for transactions of this type and other covenants agreed to by the parties, including, among others, (i) the provision of annual and quarterly financial statements, management rights and insurance policies, (ii) restrictions on incurring debt, granting liens, making acquisitions, making loans, paying dividends, dissolving, and entering into leases and asset sales and (iii) compliance with a collateral coverage covenant based on third party valuation. The Loan Agreement also provides for customary events of default, including, among others, payment, bankruptcy, covenant, representation and warranty, change of control and judgment defaults. The Loan Agreement provides that if there is an event of default due to the Company’s insolvency or if the Company fails to perform in any material respect the servicing requirements for fuel cell systems under certain customer agreements, which failure would entitle the customer to terminate such customer agreement, replace the Company or withhold the payment of any material amount to the Company under such customer agreement, then the Lender has the right to cause Proton Services Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, to replace the Company in performing the maintenance services under such customer agreement.

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. Indenture and Notes On May 13, 2020, Plug Power Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), agreed to sell to the several initial purchasers (the “Initial Purchasers”), and the Initial Purchasers agreed to purchase from the Company, $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the “initial notes”), pursuant to a purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) between the Company and the Initial Purchasers. The Company also granted the Initial Purchasers an option to purchase from the Company up to an additional $30.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the “additional notes” and, together with the initial notes, the “notes”) pursuant to the Purchase Agreement for a period of 13 days from, and including, the date the initial notes are issued. The issuance of the initial notes was consummated on May 18, 2020 (the “Closing Date”). The net proceeds the Company received from the offering of the notes was approximately $193.4 million, after deducting the Initial Purchasers’ discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by the Company. On the Closing Date, the Company used $15.3 million of the net proceeds from the offering of the initial notes to pay the cost of the Base Capped Call Transactions (as defined below) and approximately $90.9 million of the net proceeds from the offering of the initial notes to finance the cash portion of the consideration it delivered in connection with the Notes Repurchase Transactions (as defined below). The Company intends to use the remaining net proceeds from the offering to fund eligible green projects designed to contribute to selected Sustainable Development Goals as defined by the United Nations and for working capital and other general corporate purposes, which may include potential acquisitions and strategic transactions. If the Initial Purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes, the Company expects to use a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the additional notes to enter into Additional Capped Call Transactions (as defined below). The initial notes were, and any additional notes will be, issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of the Closing Date (the “Indenture”), between the Company and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”). The notes bear interest at a rate of 3.75% per annum on the principal amount thereof, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2020, to the holders of record of the notes as of the close of business on the immediately preceding May 15 and November 15, respectively. The notes will mature on June 1, 2025, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased in accordance with their terms. The notes are the senior, unsecured obligations of the Company and rank senior in right of payment to any of the Company’s indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the notes, equal in right of payment to any of the Company’s existing and future liabilities that are not so subordinated, including the Company’s 5.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the “2023 notes”), effectively junior in right of payment to any of the Company’s secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness, and structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, of its current or future subsidiaries. Holders may convert their notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding December 1, 2024 in the following circumstances: • during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on September 30, 2020 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price per share of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“common stock”), exceeds 130% of the conversion price for each of at least 20 trading days, whether or not consecutive, during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter; • during the five business days after any five consecutive trading day period (such five consecutive trading day period, the “measurement period”) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price per share of the Company’s common stock and the conversion rate for the notes on each such trading day; • if the Company calls any or all of the notes for redemption, any such notes that have been called for redemption may be converted at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; and • upon the occurrence of specified corporate events, as provided in the Indenture. On or after December 1, 2024, to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, holders may convert all or any portion of their notes at the applicable conversion rate at any time at the option of the holder regardless of the foregoing conditions. The initial conversion rate for the notes will be 198.6196 shares of the Company’s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $5.03 per share of the Company’s common stock, and is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events as set forth in the Indenture. Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver, as applicable, cash, shares of the Company’s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company’s common stock, at the Company’s election. In addition, following certain corporate events or following issuance of a notice of redemption, the Company will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its notes in connection with such a corporate event or convert its notes called for redemption during the related redemption period in certain circumstances. The notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at the Company’s option at any time, and from time to time, on or after June 5, 2023 and before the 41st scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, at a cash redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, but only if the last reported sale price per share of the Company’s common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive), including at least one of the three trading days immediately preceding the date the Company sends the related redemption notice, during any 30 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company sends such redemption notice. No sinking fund is provided for the notes. If the Company undergoes a “fundamental change” (as defined in the Indenture), holders may require the Company to repurchase their notes for cash all or any portion of their notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. The Indenture includes customary terms and covenants, including certain events of default. The events of default, as set forth in the Indenture, include (i) default by the Company in the payment when due (whether at maturity, upon optional redemption or any required repurchase, upon declaration of acceleration or otherwise) of the principal of any notes, (ii) default by the Company for 30 consecutive days in the payment when due of interest on any note, (iii) failure by the Company to comply with its obligations to convert the notes in accordance with the Indenture upon exercise of a holder’s conversion right, and such failure continues for five business days, (iv) failure by the Company to give (x) a fundamental change notice, (y) a notice of certain distributions as provided in the Indenture or (z) a notice of certain corporate events as provided in the Indenture, in each case, when required by the Indenture and, in the case of clause (z), if such failure is not cured within three business days after its occurrence, (v) failure by the Company to comply with its obligations under the Indenture in respect of certain consolidation, merger and asset sale transactions, (vi) failure by the Company for 60 days after written notice from the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the notes then outstanding has been received by the Company and the Trustee to comply with any of its other agreements under the Indenture or the notes, (vii) default by the Company or any of its “significant subsidiaries” (as defined in the Indenture) with respect to indebtedness for borrowed money of at least $25.0 million (x) resulting in such indebtedness becoming or being declared due and payable or (y) constituting a failure to pay the principal or interest of any such indebtedness when due and payable at its stated maturity or otherwise, in each case, subject to cure period and notice requirements specified in the Indenture, (viii) final judgment or judgments for the payment of $25.0 million or more (excluding any amounts covered by insurance) in the aggregate rendered against the Company or any of its significant subsidiaries and (viii) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization involving the Company or any of its significant subsidiaries. If an event of default involving certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization with respect to the Company occurs, then the principal amount of, and all accrued and unpaid interest on, all of the notes then outstanding will immediately become due and payable without any action or notice by any person. If any other event of default occurs and is continuing, either the Trustee, by notice to the Company, or the holders of at least 25% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding, by notice to the Company and the Trustee, may declare the principal amount of, and all accrued and unpaid interest on, all of the notes then outstanding to become due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may elect, at its option, that the sole remedy for an event of default relating to certain failures by the Company to comply with certain reporting covenants in the Indenture consists exclusively of the right of the holders of the notes to receive special interest on the notes for up to 360 days. In certain circumstances if, at any time during the six-month period beginning on, and including, the date that is six months after the last date of original issuance of the notes, the Company fails to timely file certain documents or reports required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the notes are not otherwise freely tradable by holders of the notes other than the Company’s affiliates, additional interest will accrue on the notes during the period in which the Company’s failure to file has occurred and is continuing or such notes are not otherwise freely tradable by holders other than the Company’s affiliates. In addition, if, and for so long as, the restrictive legend on the notes has not been removed in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the notes, the notes are assigned a restricted CUSIP number or the notes are not otherwise freely tradable by holders other than the Company’s affiliates (without restrictions pursuant to U.S. securities laws or the terms of the Indenture or the notes) as of the 375th day after the last date of original issuance of the notes, the Company will pay additional interest on the notes during the period in which the notes remain so restricted. The initial notes were, and any additional notes will be, offered and sold in a private placement conducted pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The offer and sale of the notes and any shares of the Company’s common stock issuable upon conversion thereof have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any applicable state securities laws, and the notes and any such shares may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws. This Current Report on Form 8-K is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any security and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful. A copy of the Indenture and form of 3.75% Convertible Senior Note due 2025 are filed as Exhibit 4.1 and Exhibit 4.2, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated by reference herein. The foregoing description of the Indenture and notes does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to such exhibits. Capped Call Transactions In connection with the pricing of the initial notes on May 13, 2020, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (together, the “Base Capped Call Transactions”) with Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (together, the “Option Counterparties”). The Base Capped Call Transactions cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the aggregate number of shares of the Company’s common stock that underlie the initial notes, and are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to the Company’s common stock upon any conversion of initial notes and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted initial notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap, based on the cap price of the Base Capped Call Transactions. The cap price of the Base Capped Call Transactions is initially $6.7560, which represents a premium of approximately 60% over the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock on May 13, 2020. The cost of the Base Capped Call Transactions was approximately $15.3 million. If the Initial Purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes, the Company expects to use a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the additional notes to enter into additional capped call transactions with the Option Counterparties (together, the “Additional Capped Call Transactions” and, together with the Base Capped Call Transactions, the “Capped Call Transactions”). The Base Capped Call Transactions are, and any Additional Capped Call Transactions will be, separate transactions, in each case entered into between the Company and the respective Option Counterparty, and are not part of the terms of the notes and will not affect any holder’s rights under the notes. Holders of the notes will not have any rights with respect to the Capped Call Transactions. The Base Capped Call Transactions were, and any Additional Capped Call Transactions will be, entered into by the Company with the Option Counterparties in reliance upon Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act in transactions not involving any public offering. This Current Report on Form 8-K is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any security and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful. Copies of the base call option confirmations with each of the Option Counterparties are filed as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated by reference herein. The foregoing description of the Capped Call Transactions does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to such exhibits. Amendment to the Forward Stock Purchase Transaction In connection with the issuance of the notes, the Company amended and extended the maturity of the prepaid forward stock purchase transaction that it previously entered into with Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC in connection with the issuance of the 2023 notes (the “Prepaid Forward Extension”). The Prepaid Forward Extension is intended to facilitate privately negotiated transactions by which investors in the notes will be able to hedge their investment. The aggregate number of shares of the Company’s common stock underlying the Prepaid Forward Extension is 14,397,906. The expiration date for the Prepaid Forward Extension is June 1, 2025. Upon settlement of the prepaid forward stock purchase transaction, as amended, at expiration or upon any early settlement, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC will deliver to the Company the number of shares of the Company’s common stock underlying the Prepaid Forward Extension or the portion thereof being settled early. A copy of the amendment to the forward stock purchase transaction is filed as Exhibit 10.3 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein. The foregoing description of the Prepaid Forward Extension does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to such exhibit. Contemporaneous Notes Repurchase Transactions and Anticipated Unwind of Existing Capped Call Transactions On May 13, 2020, the Company entered into separate and individually negotiated transactions with certain holders of its 2023 notes to repurchase approximately $66.3 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2023 notes for approximately $90.9 million in cash, representing a premium to the principal amount exchanged and accrued and unpaid interest thereon, and approximately 9.4 million shares of its common stock, representing the conversion value in excess thereof (collectively, the “Notes Repurchase Transactions”). As a result of the Notes Repurchase Transactions, approximately $33.7 million aggregate principal amount of the 2023 notes are outstanding. In connection with the issuance of the 2023 notes, the Company entered into capped call transactions (the “existing capped call transactions”) with certain financial institutions (the “existing option counterparties”). The Company intends to enter into agreements with the existing option counterparties to terminate a portion of the existing capped call transactions in a notional amount corresponding to the principal amount of such 2023 notes exchanged. The Company intends to use proceeds that it receives from any such terminations for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant. The information set forth under Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated herein by reference. Item 3.02. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities. The information set forth under Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated herein by reference. The initial notes were, and any additional notes will be, issued to the Initial Purchasers in reliance upon Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act in transactions not involving any public offering. The initial notes were, and any additional notes will be, resold by the Initial Purchasers to persons whom the Initial Purchasers reasonably believe are “qualified institutional buyers” in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act. Any shares of the Company’s common stock that may be issued upon conversion of the notes will be issued in reliance upon Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act as involving an exchange by the Company exclusively with its security holders. The Base Capped Call Transactions were, and any Additional Capped Call Transactions will be, entered into by the Company with the Option Counterparties in reliance upon Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act in transactions not involving any public offering. The Company relied on this exemption from registration based in part on representations made by the Option Counterparties. The shares of common stock issued to holders of the 2023 notes that participated in the Notes Repurchase Transactions were issued in reliance upon Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act in transactions not involving any public offering. The Company relied on this exemption from registration based in part on representations made by the holders of the 2023 notes. This Current Report on Form 8-K is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any security and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.

On August 24, 2022, Plug Power Inc. (the “Company”) and Amazon.com, Inc.

The Company and Amazon entered into the Transaction Agreement in connection with a concurrent commercial arrangement under which Amazon agreed to purchase hydrogen fuel from the Company. Warrant 1,000,000 of the Warrant Shares vested immediately upon issuance of the Warrant. 15,000,00 of the Warrant Shares will vest in multiple tranches over the 7-year term of the Warrant based on payments made to the Company directly by Amazon or its affiliates, or indirectly through third parties, with 15,000,000 of the Warrant Shares fully vesting if Amazon-related payments of $2.1 billion are made in the aggregate. The exercise price for the first 9,000,000 Warrant Shares is $22.9841 per share.

The Warrant is exercisable through August 24, 2029. Upon the consummation of certain change of control transactions (as defined in the Warrant) prior to the vesting of at least 60% of the aggregate Warrant Shares, the Warrant will automatically vest and become exercisable with respect to an additional number of Warrant Shares such that 60% of the aggregate Warrant Shares shall have vested. If a change of control transaction is consummated after the vesting of at least 60% of the aggregate Warrant Shares, then no acceleration of vesting will occur with respect to any of the unvested Warrant Shares as a result of the transaction. The exercise price and the Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrant are subject to customary antidilution adjustments. The Warrant and the Transaction Agreement are subject to the full terms and conditions set forth in each. Transaction Agreement The Transaction Agreement includes certain provisions relating to customary registration rights, representations and warranties and covenants of the Company and Amazon, and certain restrictions on Amazon’s ability to transfer the Warrant and the Warrant Shares. The registration rights and transfer restrictions also apply to the Warrant (and underlying shares) issued by the Company to Amazon on April 4, 2017. The Warrant and of the Warrant Shares have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and were issued in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission promulgated thereunder.

Convertible Notes and the Indenture On March 22, 2018, Plug Power Inc. (the “Company”) priced its private offering of $100 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the “Notes”). The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company. The Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated March 27, 2018 (the “Indenture”), between the Company and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee. The Indenture includes customary covenants and sets forth certain events of default after which the Notes may be declared immediately due and payable and sets forth certain types of bankruptcy or insolvency events of default involving the Company after which the Notes become automatically due and payable. The Notes will mature on March 15, 2023, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. The Notes will bear interest from March 27, 2018 at a rate of 5.50% per year payable semiannually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2018. The Notes will be convertible at the option of the noteholders at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding September 15, 2022, only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on June 30, 2018 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Common Stock”), for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the “measurement period”) in which the trading price (as defined in the Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Common Stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; (3) if the Company calls any or all of the Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after September 15, 2022 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, at the option of the holder regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, the Company may satisfy its conversion obligation by paying and/or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of the Common Stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Common Stock, at the Company’s election, in the manner and subject to the terms and conditions provided in the Indenture. The conversion rate for the Notes will initially be 436.3002 shares of the Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $2.29 per share of the Common Stock. The initial conversion price of the Notes represents a premium of approximately 20% to the $1.91 per share closing price of the Common Stock on March 22, 2018. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment under certain circumstances in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. A copy of the Indenture (including the form of the Note) is attached as an exhibit to this report and is incorporated herein by reference (and this description is qualified in its entirety by reference to such document). The net proceeds from this offering were approximately $96.3 million, after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts and commissions and the estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. The Company used $16.0 million of the net proceeds to pay the cost of the Capped Call Transactions (as defined below) and approximately $27.5 million of the net proceeds to pay the cost of the Forward Stock Purchase Transactions (as defined below). The Company intends to use the remainder of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes. Capped Call and Forward Stock Purchase Transactions On March 22, 2018, in connection with the pricing of the Notes, the Company entered into capped call transactions (the “Capped Call Transactions”) with certain of the initial purchasers of the Notes or their affiliates (the “Option Counterparties”). The Capped Call Transactions are expected generally to reduce or offset the potential dilution to the Company’s common stock upon any conversion of Notes and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap based on the cap price. The cap price of the capped call transactions will initially be $3.82 per share, which represents a premium of 100% over the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock of $1.91 per share on March 22, 2018, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the Capped Call Transactions. 2 On March 22, 2018, in connection with the sale of the Notes, the Company entered into a forward stock purchase transaction (the “Forward Stock Purchase Transaction”) pursuant to a forward stock purchase confirmation (the “Forward Stock Purchase Confirmation”) with one of the Option Counterparties, pursuant to which the Company agreed to purchase 14,397,906 shares of its Common Stock for settlement on or about March 15, 2023. The number of shares of Common Stock that the Company will ultimately repurchase under the Forward Stock Purchase Transaction is subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. On March 27, 2018, the Company used approximately $27.5 million of the proceeds from the offering to fund the cost of the Forward Stock Purchase Transaction. The Forward Stock Purchase Transaction is intended to allow investors in the Notes to establish short positions that generally correspond to (but may be greater than) commercially reasonable initial hedges of their investment in the Notes. The Forward Stock Purchase Transaction is subject to early settlement or settlement with alternative consideration in the event of certain corporate transactions. The foregoing descriptions of the Capped Call Transactions and Forward Stock Purchase Transaction are qualified in their entirety by the copies of the form of call option transaction confirmation relating to the Capped Call Transactions and the forward stock purchase confirmation relating to the Forward Stock Purchase Transaction which are attached as exhibits to this report and incorporated herein by reference. Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant. The information set forth under Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated herein by reference. Item 3.02 Unregistered Sale of Equity Securities. The information set forth under Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated herein by reference. The Company offered and sold the Notes to the initial purchasers in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and for resale by the initial purchasers to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The Company relied on these exemptions from registration based in part on representations made by the initial purchasers in the Purchase Agreement. The shares of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes, if any, have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. To the extent that any shares of the Common Stock are issued upon conversion of the Notes, they will be issued in transactions anticipated to be exempt from registration under the Securities Act by virtue of Section 3(a)(9) thereof, because no commission or other remuneration is expected to be paid in connection with conversion of the Notes, as the case may be, and any resulting issuance of shares of the Common Stock.
